## Abstract

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is often touted as a paradigm shift that significantly improves Large Language Model (LLM) accuracy by incorporating external knowledge through a retrieval step. To test these claims, a small-scale benchmark study was conducted on 15 questions sourced from the SimpleQA dataset. Three providers were evaluated:

1. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 (vanilla, no retrieval)**  
2. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 + vector store RAG**  
3. **CustomGPT RAG (gpt-4.1 backend)**  

Using GPT-4.1 as a judge, the study found two RAG-based systems both achieved 100.0% accuracy, while the vanilla LLM’s accuracy stood at 20.0%. However, each RAG configuration exhibited added latency, with average response times up to 13,668ms. This article breaks down the experiment’s methodology, results, comparative latency analysis, and implications for technical practitioners considering whether the gains in accuracy justify the added computational overhead.

## Introduction

As large language models have grown more capable in natural language understanding, challenges related to factual consistency and hallucination have become increasingly visible. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to address these limitations by providing the model with external, relevant context during generation. Rather than relying solely on the parameters of an LLM, RAG queries an external knowledge source—such as a vector database—at inference time.

To evaluate whether RAG-based approaches truly outperform a plain LLM setup (“vanilla” prompt completion with no retrieval), this study uses a small test dataset and a standardized judging process. The study’s findings showcase a stark difference between conventional LLM performance and RAG-augmented approaches, yet they also highlight cost, latency, and practical trade-offs for production use.

## Methodology

### Data and Questions

- **Dataset**: SimpleQA (15 questions).  
- **Rationale**: An intentionally small sample size was chosen for ease of manual auditing and to facilitate thorough logging. Researchers explicitly prioritized detailed evaluation over scale in this study.

### Systems Under Test

1. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 (Vanilla)**  
   - No external retrieval.  
   - Prompts are fed directly to GPT-4.1.  

2. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 + Vector Store RAG**  
   - Leverages the GPT-4.1 engine in tandem with a vector database lookup.  
   - The text embeddings are generated, and a retrieval step surfaces relevant context to guide the response.  

3. **CustomGPT RAG (GPT-4.1 Backend)**  
   - Similar architectural concept to the OpenAI RAG approach but maintained under a “CustomGPT” brand.  
   - Also uses GPT-4.1, with RAG to fetch external data.  

### Evaluation Mechanism

- **GPT-4.1 LLM-as-a-Judge**: All 15 queries were evaluated by GPT-4.1. The judge used a standardized grading scheme with detailed reasoning to decide whether each model’s answer was “CORRECT” or “INCORRECT.” 
- **Parallel Evaluation**: The three systems were queried in parallel on each of the 15 questions. Their responses—and the judge’s assessments—were recorded in comprehensive audit logs.  
- **Reproducibility**: Complete request/response logs and judge explanations are available (in the context of the study) for independent review. This ensures that future researchers can replicate the exact pipeline and verify the responses.

### Key Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of questions labeled “CORRECT” by the judge.  
- **Provider Ranking**: Ordered by accuracy, with corresponding letter grades assigned according to study definitions.  
- **Latency**: Measured in milliseconds (ms) for each request. Additional metrics include average requests per second.  
- **Judge Statistics**: The study also monitored how quickly the GPT-4.1 judge reached a verdict on each query, referred to as “judge latency.”

## Results Overview

The study’s findings yielded clear distinctions between the vanilla GPT-4.1 approach and the two RAG-based methods. Despite the small sample size (15 questions), the disparity in accuracy was substantial:

1. **OpenAI_RAG**:  
   - Accuracy: 100.0%  
   - Grade: A+  
   - Average Duration: 10.4s  
2. **CustomGPT_RAG**:  
   - Accuracy: 100.0%  
   - Grade: A+  
   - Average Duration: 17.1s  
3. **OpenAI_Vanilla**:  
   - Accuracy: 20.0%  
   - Grade: F  
   - Average Duration: 4.5s  

Although both RAG systems achieved the same overall accuracy (100.0%), they showed different average durations. According to the provided data, CustomGPT RAG had a slower average duration (17.1s) than OpenAI RAG (10.4s), but the study did not delve into potential causes, such as model configuration or hardware differences.

The study also collected details on each system’s latency in milliseconds:

- **OpenAI_RAG**: 6,992ms (0.14 requests/sec)  
- **CustomGPT_RAG**: 13,668ms (0.07 requests/sec)  
- **OpenAI_Vanilla**: 985ms (1.02 requests/sec)  

As expected, the vanilla system was the fastest but the least accurate, while the RAG-based solutions were slower yet performed significantly better.

## Performance Deep Dive

### Accuracy Disparities

Both RAG solutions scored 100.0% accuracy. Because the dataset contained 15 questions, each RAG system answered all 15 queries correctly. In contrast, the vanilla GPT-4.1 system managed only 3 correct answers out of 15, representing 20.0%. 

It is worth noting that the judge’s overall grade distribution—11 labeled CORRECT, 4 labeled INCORRECT, 0 labeled NOT_ATTEMPTED—reflects the final outcomes across some dimension of the evaluation. The direct correlation of these 11 correct vs. 4 incorrect judgments to the systems’ overall 15 questions is partially summarized as:

- RAG systems: 15 correct answers (combined).  
- Vanilla LLM: 3 correct, 12 incorrect.  

Any deeper breakdown of question-by-question correctness is not provided in the data.

### Statistical Confidence

No confidence intervals were explicitly reported. With 15 total evaluation questions, sampling variability should be acknowledged. For a more robust statistical measure, a larger and more diverse sample of questions (data not provided in the current study) would be required. Given the small sample, these results are illustrative and suggest a strong directional trend favoring RAG; however, best practices would recommend repeating the experiments on more expansive datasets to bolster external validity.

## Latency Analysis

The latency results are as follows:

- **OpenAI_RAG**: 6,992ms (0.14 requests/sec)  
- **CustomGPT_RAG**: 13,668ms (0.07 requests/sec)  
- **OpenAI_Vanilla**: 985ms (1.02 requests/sec)  

In practical terms, the vanilla GPT-4.1 model responds fastest, with an average of under 1 second per query (985ms). By contrast, the RAG systems require 6.992 seconds and 13.668 seconds on average, respectively. The slower speed is not unexpected; RAG demands additional operations, including embedding computation and vector database lookups.

### Trade-Off: Accuracy vs. Speed

For some real-time applications (e.g., rapidly changing chat interactions, high-frequency user queries), a 10–14 second latency could be prohibitive. In such contexts, the 1-second response of the vanilla system might be preferable, even at the cost of accuracy. Conversely, for applications where correctness is paramount—like specialized search, legal document queries, or healthcare Q&A—the near-100% accuracy demonstrated here may justify a longer wait time.

### Judge Latency

Beyond the system latency, the evaluation also tracked how quickly GPT-4.1 (serving as the judge) responded:

- **Average Judge Latency**: 2,154.1ms  

This judging overhead could become non-trivial in larger-scale studies, but for a single 15-query experiment, the added overhead appears manageable. The study did not benchmark alternative judging techniques or compare how different judge models might affect overall throughput. Such investigations were beyond the scope of the provided data.

## Provider Differentiation

OpenAI RAG and CustomGPT RAG both employed GPT-4.1 as their foundational model, yet they diverged slightly in latency. Specifically:

- **OpenAI_RAG**: 100.0% accuracy, ~6.992s average latency.  
- **CustomGPT_RAG**: 100.0% accuracy, ~13.668s average latency.  

The data provided does not elaborate on differences in model prompt design, retrieval pipelines, or hardware infrastructure that might explain the near double latency for CustomGPT RAG. Potential factors could include custom indexing logic, overhead in the retrieval layer, or distinct scaling configurations. Since these details are not furnished, the specific cause remains unidentified (data not provided).
