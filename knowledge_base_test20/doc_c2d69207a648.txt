================================================================================

The first female director of the University of Surrey Library, Elizabeth Esteve-Coll was raised in Darlington, the daughter of a bank clerk. She graduated from Birkbeck with a Bachelor’s degree in History and History of Art, going on to an illustrious career in the arts and academia. She was Keeper and Chief Librarian of the National Art Library for two years, then director of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum for seven years from 1988, making her the first woman to head a British national arts collection. She went on to vice chancellor roles at two universities, the University of East Anglia and the University of Lincoln, before a multiple sclerosis diagnosis forced her decision to resign. She was conferred a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1995.
