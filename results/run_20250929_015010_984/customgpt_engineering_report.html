<h2>Detailed Failure Analysis</h2>
<h3>Failure 1: simpleqa_0018</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the surname of the individual who won the Marlow Award in 1983?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: Oxtoby</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The surname of the individual who won the Marlow Award in 1983 is Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: history
- Complexity: 0.874
- Confidence: 0.99
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The predicted answer says the surname is Richardson, but the gold target states it is Oxtoby. This directly contradicts the gold answer.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Performance</strong>:
- OpenAI RAG: A
- OpenAI Vanilla: B</p>
<p>⚠️ <strong>Critical</strong>: Competitors succeeded where CustomGPT failed</p>

<h3>Failure 2: simpleqa_0016</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What are the dimensions in centimeters of the painting "Moving House" by Vasnetsov?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: 53.5 x 67.2 cm</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The dimensions of the painting "Moving House" by Viktor Vasnetsov are 53 cm in height and 67 cm in width.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: arts
- Complexity: 0.999
- Confidence: 0.9
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target is 53.5 x 67.2 cm. The predicted answer gives 53 x 67 cm. Both dimensions are slightly off (by 0.5 cm and 0.2 cm). Since the question asks for specific dimensions and the provided values do not match the gold target, this contradicts the exact measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: Boateng</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The last name of the player who got a yellow card in the 71st minute of the match between Germany and Sweden during the 2018 FIFA World Cup is Ekdal.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: sports
- Complexity: 1.560
- Confidence: 0.97
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>

<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The song for the lip sync in Episode 5, Season 1 of RuPaul's Drag Race was "Would I Lie To You?" by The Eurythmics.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: sports
- Complexity: 1.040
- Confidence: 1.0
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target states the lip sync song was "Stronger" by Britney Spears. The predicted answer states it was "Would I Lie To You?" by Eurythmics, which directly contradicts the gold. Therefore, it is incorrect.</p>

<h3>Failure 5: simpleqa_0066</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What was the complete name of the college in Delhi in which Ashraf Abbasi, the first Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, studied?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: Lady Hardinge Medical College</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The complete name of the college in Delhi where Ashraf Abbasi studied is Lady Hardinge Medical College for Girls.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: geography
- Complexity: 1.208
- Confidence: 0.64
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: Gold target: Lady Hardinge Medical College. Predicted: Lady Hardinge Medical College for Girls. The addition of “for Girls” changes the official name and is not in the gold. Since the instruction says contradictions or wrong info are incorrect, and the complete name asked should match the official name, the predicted includes an extra phrase not in gold. Therefore it does not match exactly and could be considered incorrect.</p>

<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: Martina Trevisan was eliminated in the semifinals of the 2020 French Open – Women's Singles.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:

<h3>Failure 7: simpleqa_0143</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the name of the organization to which the Society of Illustrators sold the rights to their Illustrator Show skits in 1925?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: Shubert Organization</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The Society of Illustrators sold the rights to their Illustrator Show skits in 1925 to the Shubert family, who used them for their Broadway productions of "Artists and Models."</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: entertainment
- Complexity: 1.365
- Confidence: 0.8
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target specifies the organization as the Shubert Organization. The predicted answer states “the Shubert family,” which is not the same as naming the organization. While related, it does not match the specified organizational name and thus contradicts the exact required entity.</p>

<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: history
- Complexity: 1.450
- Confidence: 0.9
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target specifies a specific date: 8 January 1994. The predicted answer states only “January 1994” without the exact day. While it does not contradict the gold target, it is incomplete since the question asks for day, month, and year. According to rules, to be correct it must contain key information; missing the day means it lacks key detail.</p>

<h3>Failure 42: simpleqa_0947</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: How many A-frame structures does the 1961 Stebel House in Los Angeles comprise?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: 3</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The 1961 Stebel House in Los Angeles comprises a dramatic A-frame rafter design supported by a beamed and bolted X-frame foundation. The structure is noted for its singular, striking A-frame form, which is a defining architectural feature of the house. There is no indication in my knowledge base of multiple separate A-frame structures; the house is characterized by its primary, cohesive A-frame design.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: general
- Complexity: 1.228
- Confidence: 0.98
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target states the Stebel House comprises 3 A-frame structures. The predicted answer claims it has a singular A-frame and denies multiple structures. This contradicts the gold target.</p>

<h3>Failure 43: simpleqa_0945</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What was the full three-word name of the crystal that the gnome who piloted the airship in the motion simulator Questor, which first opened at Busch Gardens Williamsburg in 1990, was seeking as the ultimate goal of his expedition?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: Crystal of Zed</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: The full three-word name of the crystal sought by the gnome Alwyn in the Questor motion simulator at Busch Gardens Williamsburg was the "Crystal of Zedd."</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: general
- Complexity: 1.338
- Confidence: 0.9
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: Gold target is “Crystal of Zed.” Predicted answer says “Crystal of Zedd.” The extra ‘d’ changes the specific name; semantic meaning depends on exact proper noun. This contradicts the gold target’s spelling and is not the same entity. Therefore incorrect.</p>

<h3>Failure 44: simpleqa_0974</h3>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What day, month, and year did the actor Dylan Sprouse marry Barbara Palvin?</p>
<p><strong>Target Answer</strong>: 15 of July of 2023</p>
<p><strong>CustomGPT Answer</strong>: Dylan Sprouse married Barbara Palvin in July 2023. The ceremony took place in the bride's home country of Hungary, outside of Budapest. The exact day is not specified in my knowledge base.</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>:
- Domain: history
- Complexity: 1.165
- Confidence: 0.9
- Penalty Points: 4.0</p>
<p><strong>Judge Reasoning</strong>: The gold target specifies the exact date: 15 July 2023. The predicted answer only gives July 2023 and explicitly states the exact day is not specified. It lacks the day component required by the question and gold target. While it doesn't contradict the month/year, it is incomplete and thus not meeting the key information requirement.</p>
