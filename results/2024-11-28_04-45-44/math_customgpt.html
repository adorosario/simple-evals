    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For coin \( A \) (3 tosses):
     - \( P(A = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

   - For coin \( B \) (2 tosses):
     - \( P(B = 0) = \binom{2}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
     - \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( P(B = 2) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where \( A &gt; B \):**
   - \( P(A = 1 \text{ and } B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 2 \text{ and } B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 2 \text{ and } B = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
   - \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
   - \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

4. **Sum the probabilities:**
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   Convert all fractions to a common denominator of 32:
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s use the properties of the modulus of complex numbers.

Given:
- \(|a| = 6\)
- \(|b| = 4\)

We need to find \(\left| \frac{a}{b} \right|\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Property of Modulus**:
   - The modulus of the quotient of two complex numbers is the quotient of their moduli:
   \[
   \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}
   \]

2. **Substitute the given values**:

   - \(|b| = 4\)
   \[
   \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{6}{4}

    <pre>To solve the inequalities \(0 \ge 54p - 144\) and \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\), we will solve each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.

1. **Solve the first inequality**:
   \[
   0 \ge 54p - 144
   \]
   Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]
   Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

2. **Solve the second inequality**:
   \[
   0 &gt; 12 - 20p
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]
   Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

3. **Find the intersection of the solutions**:
   - From the first inequality: \(p \le \frac{8}{3}\)
   - From the second inequality: \(p &gt; \frac{3}{5}\)

   The intersection of these two inequalities is:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity to find \(\cos \angle RPQ\):**
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), so \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos^2 \theta\):**
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\).

4. **Find \(\cos \theta\):**
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\).

5. **Determine the relationship between \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\):**
   - Since \(S\) and \(Q\) are on the same horizontal line and \(P\) is the origin, \(\angle RPS\) is the same as \(\angle RPQ\).

6. **Conclude the value of \(\cos \angle RPS\):**
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ = \frac{24}{25}\).

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2:**
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents:**
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \) for all these moduli, we can write:
   \[
   k = 3a + 1 = 4b + 1 = 5c + 1 = 6d + 1 = 7e + 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   \]

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and the required solution:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his speed \( S \).
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \(a\) and \(b\). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) is twelve times one of the integers.

Let&#39;s use the relationship between GCD and LCM:
\[ \text{GCD}(a, b) \times \text{LCM}(a, b) = a \times b \]

Since the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 3, we can write:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers (i.e., \(\text{GCD}(m, n) = 1\)).

Given that the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is twelve times one of the integers, we have two cases to consider:
1. \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = 12a\)
2. \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = 12b\)

### Case 1: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = 12a\)
\[ \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 12 \times 3m \]
\[ 3 \times \text{LCM}(m, n) = 36m \]
Since \(\text{LCM}(m, n) = mn\) (because \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime),
\[ 3mn = 36m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

### Case 2: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = 12b\)
\[ \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 12 \times 3n \]
\[ 3 \times \text{LCM}(m, n) = 36n \]
Since \(\text{LCM}(m, n) = mn\) (because \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime),
\[ 3mn = 36n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

In both cases, we have:
- \(a = 3m\) and \(b = 3n\)
- \(m = 12\) and \(n = 1\) (or vice versa)

Thus, the integers are:
\[ a = 3 \times 12 = 36 \]
\[ b = 3 \times 1 = 3 \]

The sum of the two integers is:
\[ 36 + 3 = 39 \]

To ensure we have the largest possible sum, we should check if there are any other combinations of \(m\) and \(n\) that satisfy the conditions. However, since \(m\) and \(n\) must be coprime and the LCM condition must hold, the above solution is the only valid one.

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times). We will assume that each coin toss is fair, meaning the probability of heads (H) or tails (T) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **List all possible outcomes for coin \( A \) (3 tosses):**
   - The number of heads can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - The probabilities for each number of heads can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \), where \( n \) is the number of trials, \( k \) is the number of successes, and \( p \) is the probability of success.

   - \( P(\text{0 heads}) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)
   - \( P(\text{1 head}) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
   - \( P(\text{2 heads}) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
   - \( P(\text{3 heads}) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)

2. **List all possible outcomes for coin \( B \) (2 tosses):**
   - The number of heads can be 0, 1, or 2.
   - The probabilities for each number of heads can be calculated similarly.

   - \( P(\text{0 heads}) = \binom{2}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - \( P(\text{1 head}) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - \( P(\text{2 heads}) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) than using coin \( B \):**
   - We need to consider all combinations where the number of heads from coin \( A \) is greater than the number of heads from coin \( B \).

   - \( P(\text{A &gt; B}) = P(\text{A = 1, B = 0}) + P(\text{A = 2, B = 0}) + P(\text{A = 2, B = 1}) + P(\text{A = 3, B = 0}) + P(\text{A = 3, B = 1}) + P(\text{A = 3, B = 2}) \)

   - Calculate each term:
     - \( P(\text{A = 1, B = 0}) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(\text{A = 2, B = 0}) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(\text{A = 2, B = 1}) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
     - \( P(\text{A = 3, B = 0}) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
     - \( P(\text{A = 3, B = 1}) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
     - \( P(\text{A = 3, B = 2}) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

   - Sum these probabilities:
     - \( \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} \)
     - Convert to a common denominator (32):
       - \( \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} \)

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that the smallest book must not be placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s denote the books as \( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4 \) where \( B_1 \) is the smallest book.

1. **Total Arrangements Without Constraints:**
   - There are 4 books, so the total number of ways to arrange them without any constraints is \( 4! \).
   - \( 4! = 24 \).

2. **Arrangements with the Smallest Book at the End:**
   - If the smallest book \( B_1 \) is placed at the end (where the hole is), the remaining 3 books can be arranged in any order.
   - The number of ways to arrange the remaining 3 books is \( 3! \).
   - \( 3! = 6 \).

3. **Valid Arrangements:**
   - To find the number of valid arrangements where the smallest book is not at the end, we subtract the invalid arrangements from the total arrangements.
   - Valid arrangements = Total arrangements - Invalid arrangements.
   - Valid arrangements = \( 24 - 6 = 18 \).

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers**:

     \[
     \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are the same angle in this context, \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

5. **Final answer**:
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \frac{24}{25}\)

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all these numbers.
   - LCM(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = LCM(3, 4, 5, 7) since 6 is already covered by 3 and 2 (which is part of 4).
   - LCM(3, 4, 5, 7) = 3 * 4 * 5 * 7 = 420 (since 3, 4, 5, and 7 are all relatively prime).

3. **Form the General Solution**:
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{420} \).
   - This means \( k = 420n + 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

4. **Find the Largest \( k \) Less Than 1000**:
   - We need \( 420n + 1 &lt; 1000 \).
   - Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     420n + 1 &lt; 1000
     \]
     \[
     420n &lt; 999
     \]
     \[
     n &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
     \]
   - The largest integer \( n \) is 2.

5. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
     \]

Therefore, the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is 841.

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and derive the required formula:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \( a \) and \( b \). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers.

We can express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1).

The lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \text{lcm}(3m, 3n) = 3 \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \]

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, their lcm is simply their product:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = mn \]
Thus,
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 3 \cdot mn \]

According to the problem, the lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers. Let&#39;s assume it is twelve times \( a \):
\[ 3mn = 12a \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \]
\[ mn = 12m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Now, let&#39;s check the other case where the lcm is twelve times \( b \):
\[ 3mn = 12b \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n \]
\[ mn = 12n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

So, we have two pairs of integers:
1. \( (a, b) = (3m, 3 \cdot 12) = (3m, 36) \)
2. \( (a, b) = (3 \cdot 12, 3n) = (36, 3n) \)

To find the largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to maximize \( a + b \) under the constraint that both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

For the first pair:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 36 \]
\[ a + b = 3m + 36 \]
Since \( a &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3m &lt; 100 \]
\[ m &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( m \) can be is 33:
\[ a = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 99 + 36 = 135 \]

For the second pair:
\[ a = 36 \]
\[ b = 3n \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 3n \]
Since \( b &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3n &lt; 100 \]
\[ n &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( n \) can be is 33:
\[ b = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 99 = 135 \]

In both cases, the largest possible sum of the two integers is 135.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For coin \( A \) (3 tosses):
     - \( P(A = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

   - For coin \( B \) (2 tosses):
     - \( P(B = 0) = \binom{2}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
     - \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( P(B = 2) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where \( A &gt; B \):**
   - \( P(A = 1, B = 0) = P(A = 1) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 2, B = 0) = P(A = 2) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 2, B = 1) = P(A = 2) \cdot P(B = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
   - \( P(A = 3, B = 0) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
   - \( P(A = 3, B = 1) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
   - \( P(A = 3, B = 2) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

4. **Sum the probabilities where \( A &gt; B \):**
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that the smallest book must not be placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of arrangements without any constraints**:
   - Alex has 4 books, which can be arranged in \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways.
   - \(4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\)

2. **Identify the invalid arrangements**:
   - The smallest book can be placed in 4 positions. However, if it is placed at the end with the hole, it will fall through.
   - There is only 1 position (the end with the hole) where the smallest book cannot be placed.

3. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is placed in any of the other 3 positions, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in any order.
   - The number of ways to arrange the remaining 3 books is \(3!\) (3 factorial).
   - \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\)

4. **Multiply the number of valid positions for the smallest book by the number of arrangements of the remaining books**:
   - There are 3 valid positions for the smallest book.
   - For each valid position, there are 6 ways to arrange the remaining books.
   - Total valid arrangements = \(3 \times 6 = 18\)

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s address each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Solutions

We need to find the intersection of the two solutions:
- \( p \le \frac{8}{3} \)
- \( p &gt; \frac{3}{5} \)

In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity to find \(\cos \angle RPQ\):**
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\)
   - Therefore, \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos^2 \theta\):**
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625}\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625}\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{576}{625}\)

4. **Find \(\cos \theta\):**
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

5. **Determine the relationship between \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\):**
   - Since \(S\) is on the opposite side of \(P\) from \(Q\), \(\angle RPS\) is the same as \(\angle RPQ\).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ = \frac{24}{25}\)

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2**:
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents**:
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}
   \]

3. **Evaluate the logarithm**:
   - \(\log_2 (2^{7/2})\) simplifies to the exponent:
   \[
   \log_2 (2^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2}

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - We need \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 will give us the smallest number that is divisible by all these numbers.
   - LCM(3, 4, 5, 6, 7):
     - Prime factorization:
       - 3: \( 3 \)
       - 4: \( 2^2 \)
       - 5: \( 5 \)
       - 6: \( 2 \times 3 \)
       - 7: \( 7 \)
     - LCM: \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 420 \)

3. **Formulating the General Solution**:
   - We need \( k \) to be 1 more than a multiple of 420.
   - Therefore, \( k = 420m + 1 \) for some integer \( m \).

4. **Finding the Largest \( k \) Less Than 1000**:
   - We need \( 420m + 1 &lt; 1000 \).
   - Solving for \( m \):
     - \( 420m &lt; 999 \)
     - \( m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38 \)
     - The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

5. **Calculating \( k \)**:
   - For \( m = 2 \):
     - \( k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841 \)

Thus, the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. We will then sum these values to find \(a + b + c\).

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - The vertex form of a parabola \(x = a(y - k)^2 + h\) can help us identify the vertex.
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((1, -3)\).

2. **Convert the vertex form to standard form**:
   - The vertex form of the equation is \(x = a(y + 3)^2 + 1\).
   - Expanding this, we get:
     \[
     x = a(y^2 + 6y + 9) + 1
     \]
     \[
     x = ay^2 + 6ay + 9a + 1
     \]

3. **Compare with the standard form \(x = ay^2 + by + c\)**:
   - From the expanded form, we can identify:
     \[
     a = a, \quad b = 6a, \quad c = 9a + 1
     \]

4. **Determine the value of \(a\)**:
   - To find the value of \(a\), we need another point on the parabola. From the graph, we can see that the point \((0, 0)\) lies on the parabola.
   - Substitute \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     0 = a(0)^2 + 6a(0) + 9a + 1
     \]
     \[
     0 = 9a + 1
     \]
     \[
     9a = -1
     \]
     \[
     a = -\frac{1}{9}
     \]

5. **Calculate \(b\) and \(c\)**:
   - Using \(a = -\frac{1}{9}\):
     \[
     b = 6a = 6 \left(-\frac{1}{9}\right) = -\frac{6}{9} = -\frac{2}{3}
     \]
     \[
     c = 9a + 1 = 9 \left(-\frac{1}{9}\right) + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0
     \]

6. **Sum \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)**:
   - Now, we sum the values:
     \[
     a + b + c = -\frac{1}{9} - \frac{2}{3} + 0
     \]
     \[
     a + b + c = -\frac{1}{9} - \frac{6}{9}
     \]
     \[
     a + b + c = -\frac{7}{9}
     \]

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Bob&#39;s speed is the distance traveled divided by the time taken.
   - Speed = \( \frac{m \text{ miles}}{h \text{ hours}} \).

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Time = Distance / Speed.
   - Distance = \( h \) miles.
   - Speed = \( \frac{m \text{ miles}}{h \text{ hours}} \).

4. **Calculate the Time**:
   - Time = \( \frac{h \text{ miles}}{\frac{m \text{ miles}}{h \text{ hours}}} \).
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}
     \]

Therefore, the time it would take Bob to travel \( h \) miles is \( \frac{h^2}{m} \) hours.

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and the required solution:

1. **Given Information**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3.
   - The least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) is twelve times one of the integers.

2. **Express the integers**:
   - Let \(a = 3m\) and \(b = 3n\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime (since the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 3).

3. **LCM and GCD relationship**:
   - The relationship between GCD and LCM is given by:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(a, b) \times \text{LCM}(a, b) = a \times b
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     3 \times \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 3m \times 3n
     \]
     \[
     3 \times \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 9mn
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 3mn
     \]

4. **LCM condition**:
   - The LCM is twelve times one of the integers. Assume:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 12 \times 3m \quad \text{or} \quad \text{LCM}(3m, 3n) = 12 \times 3n
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3mn = 36m \quad \text{or} \quad 3mn = 36n
     \]
     \[
     mn = 12m \quad \text{or} \quad mn = 12n
     \]
   - Solving for \(n\) and \(m\):
     \[
     n = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad m = 12
     \]

5. **Determine the integers**:
   - If \(n = 12\), then \(b = 3n = 36\) and \(a = 3m\) where \(m\) is coprime with 12.
   - If \(m = 12\), then \(a = 3m = 36\) and \(b = 3n\) where \(n\) is coprime with 12.

6. **Find the largest possible sum**:
   - The largest possible sum occurs when the other integer is as large as possible while being coprime with 12 and less than 100.
   - The largest integer less than 100 and coprime with 12 is 11 (since 12 is not coprime with itself).

   Therefore, the integers are:
   - \(a = 36\) and \(b = 33\) (or vice versa).

   The sum is:
   \[
   36 + 33 = 69

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that the smallest book must not be placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books, which can be arranged in \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways.
   - \(4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\) total arrangements.

2. **Identify the invalid arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, but only 1 end has the hole.
   - If the smallest book is placed at the end with the hole, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways.
   - \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\) invalid arrangements.

3. **Calculate the valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the number of invalid arrangements from the total arrangements.
   - Valid arrangements = Total arrangements - Invalid arrangements.
   - Valid arrangements = 24 - 6 = 18.

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the magnitude of the quotient of two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\) given their magnitudes \(|a| = 6\) and \(|b| = 4\).

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers**:
   - For any two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the magnitude of their quotient is given by:
     \[
     \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}
     \]

2. **Substitute the given magnitudes**:
   - Given \(|a| = 6\) and \(|b| = 4\), we substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{6}{4}
     \]

3. **Simplify the fraction**:
   - Simplify \(\frac{6}{4}\) to its lowest terms:
     \[
     \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}

Therefore, the magnitude of \(\left| \frac{a}{b} \right|\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \( p \) that satisfy both inequalities \( 0 \ge 54p - 144 \) and \( 0 &gt; 12 - 20p \).

1. **Solve the first inequality**:
   \[
   0 \ge 54p - 144
   \]
   - Add 144 to both sides:
     \[
     144 \ge 54p
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 54:
     \[
     \frac{144}{54} \ge p
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]
     So,
     \[
     \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
     \]

2. **Solve the second inequality**:
   \[
   0 &gt; 12 - 20p
   \]
   - Subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     -12 &gt; -20p
     \]
   - Divide both sides by -20 (and reverse the inequality sign):
     \[
     \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}
     \]
     So,
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
     \]

3. **Combine the solutions**:
   - From the first inequality: \( p \le \frac{8}{3} \)
   - From the second inequality: \( p &gt; \frac{3}{5} \)

   Combining these, we get:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\) (since cosine is positive in the first quadrant)

4. **Determine the relationship between \(\angle RPQ\) and \(\angle RPS\)**:
   - In the given diagram, \(\angle RPS\) is the same as \(\angle RPQ\) because they share the same initial and terminal sides.

5. **Conclude the value of \(\cos \angle RPS\)**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS = \angle RPQ\), \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

Therefore, \(\cos \angle RPS = \frac{24}{25}\).

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2:**
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents:**
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}
   \]

3. **Evaluate the logarithm:**
   - \(\log_2 (2^{7/2})\) simplifies to the exponent:

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \) for each \( n \) in {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, we can combine these into a single congruence:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{\text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)} \)

3. **Calculate the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 can be found by considering the highest powers of all prime factors involved:
     - \( 3 = 3 \)
     - \( 4 = 2^2 \)
     - \( 5 = 5 \)
     - \( 6 = 2 \times 3 \)
     - \( 7 = 7 \)
   - The LCM is \( 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 4 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 420 \)

4. **Form the congruence**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{420} \)

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   - The largest multiple of 420 less than 1000 is \( 420 \times 2 = 840 \)
   - Therefore, \( k = 840 + 1 = 841 \)

6. **Verify the solution**:
   - \( 841 \div 3 = 280 \text{ remainder } 1 \)
   - \( 841 \div 4 = 210 \text{ remainder } 1 \)
   - \( 841 \div 5 = 168 \text{ remainder } 1 \)
   - \( 841 \div 6 = 140 \text{ remainder } 1 \)
   - \( 841 \div 7 = 120 \text{ remainder } 1 \)

Thus, the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 that satisfies the given conditions is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, the vertex of the parabola appears to be at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find one equation**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting this point into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - Using \(c = 1\) in the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find a third point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -2)\). Substituting this point into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-2)^2 + b(-2) + c \implies 1 = 4a - 2b + 1
     \]
     Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     0 = 4a - 2b \implies 2a = b \implies b = 2a
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     b = 2a
     \]
   - Substitute \(b = 2a\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + 2a = -4 \implies 3a = -4 \implies a = -\frac{4}{3}
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = -\frac{4}{3}\) back into \(b = 2a\):
     \[
     b = 2 \left(-\frac{4}{3}\right) = -\frac{8}{3}
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -\frac{4}{3}\), \(b = -\frac{8}{3}\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -\frac{4}{3} - \frac{8}{3} + 1 = -\frac{12}{3} + 1 = -4 + 1 = -3
     \]

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Therefore, Bob&#39;s speed is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For coin \( A \) (3 tosses):
     - \( P(A = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

   - For coin \( B \) (2 tosses):
     - \( P(B = 0) = \binom{2}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
     - \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( P(B = 2) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where \( A \) has more heads than \( B \):**
   - \( P(A &gt; B) \) is the sum of the probabilities of all favorable outcomes:
     - \( P(A = 1, B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 2, B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 2, B = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

4. **Sum the probabilities:**
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   Convert all fractions to a common denominator (32):
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraint that the smallest book must not be placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any constraints, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without constraints**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the constraint**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of invalid arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, the number of invalid arrangements is:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the number of invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s address each inequality separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. **Isolate \(p\)**:
   \[
   0 \ge 54p - 144
   \]
   Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]
   Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. **Isolate \(p\)**:
   \[
   0 &gt; 12 - 20p
   \]
   Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]
   Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Intersection of Solutions

- From Inequality 1: \(p \le \frac{8}{3}\)
- From Inequality 2: \(p &gt; \frac{3}{5}\)

Combining these, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{5} &lt; p \le \frac{8}{3}
\]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Given Information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Find \(\cos \angle RPQ\)**:
   - We know that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\).
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\).
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\) (since cosine is positive in the first quadrant).

4. **Determine \(\cos \angle RPS\)**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) is a straight angle (180 degrees) minus \(\angle RPQ\), we have:
     \[
     \cos \angle RPS = \cos (180^\circ - \angle RPQ)
     \]
   - Using the cosine identity for supplementary angles:
     \[
     \cos (180^\circ - \theta) = -\cos \theta
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \cos \angle RPS = -\cos \angle RPQ = -\frac{24}{25}
     \]

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2**:
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents**:
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   - Since \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{n} \) for \( n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we can write:
     \[
     k = 1 + m \cdot \text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
     \]
   - We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

3. **Calculate the LCM**:
   - The prime factorizations are:
     - \( 3 = 3 \)
     - \( 4 = 2^2 \)
     - \( 5 = 5 \)
     - \( 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \)
     - \( 7 = 7 \)
   - The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   - \( k = 1 + 420m \)

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   - We need \( k &lt; 1000 \):
     \[
     1 + 420m &lt; 1000
     \]
     \[
     420m &lt; 999
     \]
     \[
     m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
     \]
   - The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \) for \( m = 2 \)**:
   - \( k = 1 + 420 \cdot 2 = 1 + 840 = 841 \)

Therefore, the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 that satisfies the given conditions is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the equation of the red parabola given in the form \( x = ay^2 + by + c \) and then determine the sum \( a + b + c \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Vertex and Points:**
   - The vertex of the parabola is at \( (1, -3) \).
   - The parabola opens to the right, indicating the equation is in the form \( x = ay^2 + by + c \).

2. **Form the Equation:**
   - The vertex form of a parabola that opens to the right is \( x = a(y - k)^2 + h \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex.
   - Given the vertex \( (1, -3) \), the equation becomes:
     \[
     x = a(y + 3)^2 + 1
     \]

3. **Expand the Equation:**
   - Expand \( (y + 3)^2 \):
     \[
     (y + 3)^2 = y^2 + 6y + 9
     \]
   - Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     x = a(y^2 + 6y + 9) + 1
     \]
   - Distribute \( a \):
     \[
     x = ay^2 + 6ay + 9a + 1
     \]

4. **Identify Coefficients:**
   - Comparing \( x = ay^2 + 6ay + 9a + 1 \) with \( x = ay^2 + by + c \), we get:
     \[
     b = 6a, \quad c = 9a + 1
     \]

5. **Determine Specific Points:**
   - Use another point on the parabola to find \( a \). For example, the point \( (0, -2) \) lies on the parabola.
   - Substitute \( (0, -2) \) into the equation \( x = ay^2 + by + c \):
     \[
     0 = a(-2)^2 + 6a(-2) + 9a + 1
     \]
     \[
     0 = 4a - 12a + 9a + 1
     \]
     \[
     0 = a + 1
     \]
     \[
     a = -1
     \]

6. **Calculate \( b \) and \( c \):**
   - Substitute \( a = -1 \) into \( b = 6a \) and \( c = 9a + 1 \):
     \[
     b = 6(-1) = -6
     \]
     \[
     c = 9(-1) + 1 = -9 + 1 = -8
     \]

7. **Sum \( a + b + c \):**
   - Calculate \( a + b + c \):
     \[
     a + b + c = -1 - 6 - 8 = -15
     \]

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is calculated as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Required Outcome**:
   - We need to find out how many hours it would take Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.

4. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Time \( T \) is calculated as distance divided by speed.
   - Distance to be traveled is \( h \) miles.
   - Speed is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

5. **Calculate the Time**:
   - \( T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \)
   - \( T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} \)
   - Simplify the equation:

     T = \frac{h \cdot h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM). Let&#39;s denote the two integers as \(a\) and \(b\).

1. **Given information**:
   - The GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 3: \(\gcd(a, b) = 3\).
   - The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is twelve times one of the integers: \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = 12k\), where \(k\) is one of the integers.

2. **Express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their GCD**:
   - Since \(\gcd(a, b) = 3\), we can write \(a = 3m\) and \(b = 3n\), where \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\).

3. **Use the relationship between GCD and LCM**:
   - The relationship between GCD and LCM is given by: \(\gcd(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b\).
   - Substituting the given values: \(3 \times 12k = 3m \times 3n\).

4. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   36k = 9mn \implies 4k = mn
   \]

5. **Determine the possible values of \(m\) and \(n\)**:
   - Since \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\), \(m\) and \(n\) must be coprime.
   - We need to find pairs \((m, n)\) such that \(mn = 4k\) and both \(3m\) and \(3n\) are less than 100.

6. **Find the pairs \((m, n)\)**:
   - Possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy \(mn = 4k\) and are coprime:
     - \(m = 1, n = 4k\)
     - \(m = 4, n = k\)

7. **Check the constraints**:
   - For \(m = 1\) and \(n = 4k\):
     - \(3m = 3\) and \(3n = 12k\)
     - \(12k &lt; 100 \implies k &lt; \frac{100}{12} \approx 8.33\)
     - The largest integer \(k\) is 8, giving \(n = 32\).
     - \(a = 3 \times 1 = 3\) and \(b = 3 \times 32 = 96\)
     - Sum: \(3 + 96 = 99\)

   - For \(m = 4\) and \(n = k\):
     - \(3m = 12\) and \(3n = 3k\)
     - \(3k &lt; 100 \implies k &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33\)
     - The largest integer \(k\) is 33, giving \(n = 33\).
     - \(a = 3 \times 4 = 12\) and \(b = 3 \times 33 = 99\)
     - Sum: \(12 + 99 = 111\)

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The largest possible sum of the two integers is 111.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]
\]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are the same angle in this context, \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

5. **Final answer**:
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \frac{24}{25}\)

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2:**

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \) for all these moduli, we can write:
   \[
   k = 3a + 1 = 4b + 1 = 5c + 1 = 6d + 1 = 7e + 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   \]

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) less than 100 such that:
1. Their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 3.
2. Their least common multiple (LCM) is twelve times one of the integers.
3. We need to find the largest possible sum of these two integers.

Let&#39;s denote the integers as \(a\) and \(b\).

1. **Express the integers in terms of their GCD**:
   Since the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) is 3, we can write:
   - \(a = 3m\)
   - \(b = 3n\)
   where \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime integers (i.e., \(\text{GCD}(m, n) = 1\)).

2. **Use the LCM condition**:
   The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is given by:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} = \frac{3m \cdot 3n}{3} = 3mn
   \]
   According to the problem, the LCM is twelve times one of the integers. Without loss of generality, assume:
   \[
   3mn = 12a \quad \text{or} \quad 3mn = 12b
   \]
   Substituting \(a = 3m\) and \(b = 3n\):
   \[
   3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \quad \text{or} \quad 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   mn = 12m \quad \text{or} \quad mn = 12n
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(m\) or \(n\) respectively, we get:
   \[
   n = 12 \quad \text{or} \quad m = 12
   \]

3. **Determine the integers**:
   - If \(n = 12\), then \(b = 3n = 3 \cdot 12 = 36\).
   - If \(m = 12\), then \(a = 3m = 3 \cdot 12 = 36\).

   Therefore, the pairs \((a, b)\) are \((3m, 36)\) or \((36, 3n)\).

4. **Find the largest possible sum**:
   - If \(a = 36\), then \(b = 3n\) where \(n\) is coprime with 12 and less than 100/3.
   - If \(b = 36\), then \(a = 3m\) where \(m\) is coprime with 12 and less than 100/3.

   The largest possible values for \(m\) and \(n\) that are coprime with 12 and less than 33 are 11 and 1 respectively.

   - For \(a = 36\) and \(b = 3 \cdot 11 = 33\), the sum is \(36 + 33 = 69\).
   - For \(b = 36\) and \(a = 3 \cdot 11 = 33\), the sum is \(33 + 36 = 69\).

Thus, the largest possible sum of the two integers is:

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

Given:

- \(|b| = 4\)

We need to find \(\left| \frac{a}{b} \right|\).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers:**
   \[
   \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}
   \]

2. **Substitute the given magnitudes into the formula:**
   \[
   \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{6}{4}

3. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}

Therefore, the magnitude of \(\left| \frac{a}{b} \right|\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \) for all these moduli, we can write:
   \[
   k = 3a + 1 = 4b + 1 = 5c + 1 = 6d + 1 = 7e + 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   \]

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and derive the required formula:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \( a \) and \( b \). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers.

We can express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1).

The lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \text{lcm}(3m, 3n) = 3 \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \]

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, their lcm is simply their product:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = mn \]
Thus,
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 3 \cdot mn \]

According to the problem, the lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers. Let&#39;s assume it is twelve times \( a \):
\[ 3mn = 12a \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \]
\[ mn = 12m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Now, let&#39;s check the other case where the lcm is twelve times \( b \):
\[ 3mn = 12b \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n \]
\[ mn = 12n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

So, we have two pairs of integers:
1. \( (a, b) = (3m, 3 \cdot 12) = (3m, 36) \)
2. \( (a, b) = (3 \cdot 12, 3n) = (36, 3n) \)

To find the largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to maximize \( a + b \) under the constraint that both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

For the first pair:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 36 \]
\[ a + b = 3m + 36 \]
Since \( a &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3m &lt; 100 \]
\[ m &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( m \) can be is 33:
\[ a = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 99 + 36 = 135 \]

For the second pair:
\[ a = 36 \]
\[ b = 3n \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 3n \]
Since \( b &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3n &lt; 100 \]
\[ n &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( n \) can be is 33:
\[ b = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 99 = 135 \]

In both cases, the largest possible sum of the two integers is 135.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the magnitude of the quotient of two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\) given their magnitudes \(|a| = 6\) and \(|b| = 4\).

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers**:
   - For any two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the magnitude of their quotient is given by:
     \[
     \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are the same angle in this context, \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \( a \) and \( b \). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers.

We can express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1).

The lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \text{lcm}(3m, 3n) = 3 \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \]

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, their lcm is simply their product:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = mn \]
Thus,
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 3 \cdot mn \]

According to the problem, the lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers. Let&#39;s assume it is twelve times \( a \):
\[ 3mn = 12a \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \]
\[ mn = 12m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Now, let&#39;s check the other case where the lcm is twelve times \( b \):
\[ 3mn = 12b \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n \]
\[ mn = 12n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

So, we have two pairs of integers:
1. \( (a, b) = (3m, 3 \cdot 12) = (3m, 36) \)
2. \( (a, b) = (3 \cdot 12, 3n) = (36, 3n) \)

To find the largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to maximize \( a + b \) under the constraint that both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

For the first pair:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 36 \]
\[ a + b = 3m + 36 \]
Since \( a &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3m &lt; 100 \]
\[ m &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( m \) can be is 33:
\[ a = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 99 + 36 = 135 \]

For the second pair:
\[ a = 36 \]
\[ b = 3n \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 3n \]
Since \( b &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3n &lt; 100 \]
\[ n &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( n \) can be is 33:
\[ b = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 99 = 135 \]

In both cases, the largest possible sum of the two integers is 135.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers**:

    <div class="content">
    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are the same angle in this context, \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

5. **Final answer**:
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \frac{24}{25}\)

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2:**
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents:**
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}
   \]

3. **Evaluate the logarithm:**
   - \(\log_2 (2^{7/2})\) simplifies to the exponent:
   \[
   \log_2 (2^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2}
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \) for all these moduli, we can write:
   \[
   k = 3a + 1 = 4b + 1 = 5c + 1 = 6d + 1 = 7e + 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   \]

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and derive the required formula:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \( a \) and \( b \). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers.

We can express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1).

The lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \text{lcm}(3m, 3n) = 3 \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \]

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, their lcm is simply their product:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = mn \]
Thus,
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 3 \cdot mn \]

According to the problem, the lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers. Let&#39;s assume it is twelve times \( a \):
\[ 3mn = 12a \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \]
\[ mn = 12m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Now, let&#39;s check the other case where the lcm is twelve times \( b \):
\[ 3mn = 12b \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n \]
\[ mn = 12n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

So, we have two pairs of integers:
1. \( (a, b) = (3m, 3 \cdot 12) = (3m, 36) \)
2. \( (a, b) = (3 \cdot 12, 3n) = (36, 3n) \)

To find the largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to maximize \( a + b \) under the constraint that both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

For the first pair:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 36 \]
\[ a + b = 3m + 36 \]
Since \( a &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3m &lt; 100 \]
\[ m &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( m \) can be is 33:
\[ a = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 99 + 36 = 135 \]

For the second pair:
\[ a = 36 \]
\[ b = 3n \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 3n \]
Since \( b &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3n &lt; 100 \]
\[ n &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( n \) can be is 33:
\[ b = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 99 = 135 \]

In both cases, the largest possible sum of the two integers is 135.

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the smallest book is not placed at the end of the bookshelf where the hole is located. Let&#39;s break down the steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books and their arrangements**:
   - Alex has 4 books.
   - Without any restrictions, the total number of ways to arrange 4 books is \(4!\) (4 factorial).

2. **Calculate the total number of unrestricted arrangements**:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]

3. **Identify the restricted arrangements**:
   - The smallest book cannot be placed at the end with the hole.
   - There are 2 ends on the bookshelf, so we need to exclude the arrangements where the smallest book is at either end.

4. **Calculate the number of restricted arrangements**:
   - If the smallest book is at one end, the remaining 3 books can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.
   - Since there are 2 ends, we multiply by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 3! = 2 \times (3 \times 2 \times 1) = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of valid arrangements**:
   - Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total arrangements:
   \[
   24 - 12 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways Alex can arrange his books so that the smallest book does not fall through the hole is:

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find the magnitude of the quotient of two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\) given their magnitudes \(|a| = 6\) and \(|b| = 4\).

1. **Recall the property of magnitudes of complex numbers**:
   - For any two complex numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the magnitude of their quotient is given by:
     \[
     \left| \frac{a}{b} \right| = \frac{|a|}{|b|}

    <pre>To solve the inequalities step by step, let&#39;s start with each inequality separately.

### Inequality 1: \(0 \ge 54p - 144\)

1. Add 144 to both sides:
   \[
   144 \ge 54p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 54:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} \ge p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{144}{54} = \frac{72}{27} = \frac{24}{9} = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{8}{3} \ge p \quad \text{or} \quad p \le \frac{8}{3}
   \]

### Inequality 2: \(0 &gt; 12 - 20p\)

1. Subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   -12 &gt; -20p
   \]

2. Divide both sides by -20 (remember to reverse the inequality sign):
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} &lt; p
   \]

3. Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-12}{-20} = \frac{12}{20} = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]

   So,
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} &lt; p \quad \text{or} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
   \]

### Combining the Inequalities

We need \(p\) to satisfy both:
\[
p \le \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad p &gt; \frac{3}{5}
\]

In interval notation, this is:
\[
\left( \frac{3}{5}, \frac{8}{3} \right]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to find \(\cos \angle RPS\) given that \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\).

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \(\sin \angle RPQ = \frac{7}{25}\)

2. **Use the Pythagorean identity**:
   - The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\).
   - Let \(\theta = \angle RPQ\).
   - Given \(\sin \theta = \frac{7}{25}\), we can find \(\cos \theta\).

3. **Calculate \(\cos \theta\)**:
   - \(\sin^2 \theta = \left(\frac{7}{25}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{625}\)
   - Using the identity: \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta\)
   - \(\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{625}{625} - \frac{49}{625} = \frac{576}{625}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{\frac{576}{625}} = \frac{\sqrt{576}}{\sqrt{625}} = \frac{24}{25}\)

4. **Determine the angle relationship**:
   - Since \(\angle RPS\) and \(\angle RPQ\) are the same angle in this context, \(\cos \angle RPS = \cos \angle RPQ\).

5. **Final answer**:
   - \(\cos \angle RPS = \frac{24}{25}\)

    <pre>To evaluate \(\log_2 8\sqrt{2}\), let&#39;s break it down step by step:

1. **Express \(8\sqrt{2}\) in terms of powers of 2:**
   - \(8 = 2^3\)
   - \(\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2}\)

   Therefore,
   \[
   8\sqrt{2} = 2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2}
   \]

2. **Combine the exponents:**
   - When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents:
   \[
   2^3 \cdot 2^{1/2} = 2^{3 + 1/2} = 2^{3.5} = 2^{7/2}
   \]

3. **Evaluate the logarithm:**
   - \(\log_2 (2^{7/2})\) simplifies to the exponent:
   \[
   \log_2 (2^{7/2}) = \frac{7}{2}

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, we need to find the largest number \( k \) less than 1000 such that the remainder is 1 when \( k \) is divided by each of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

1. **Identify the condition**:
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \)
   - \( k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Combine the conditions**:
   Since \( k \equiv 1 \) for all these moduli, we can write:
   \[
   k = 3a + 1 = 4b + 1 = 5c + 1 = 6d + 1 = 7e + 1
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   k - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
   \]

3. **Find the least common multiple (LCM)**:
   - The LCM of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = \text{LCM}(3, 4) = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(12, 5) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 6) = 60
     \]
     \[
     \text{LCM}(60, 7) = 420
     \]

4. **Form the general solution**:
   \[
   k - 1 = 420m \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]
   \[
   k = 420m + 1
   \]

5. **Find the largest \( k \) less than 1000**:
   \[
   420m + 1 &lt; 1000
   \]
   \[
   420m &lt; 999
   \]
   \[
   m &lt; \frac{999}{420} \approx 2.38
   \]
   The largest integer \( m \) is 2.

6. **Calculate \( k \)**:
   \[
   k = 420 \times 2 + 1 = 841
   \]

    <pre>To solve the problem, we need to determine the coefficients \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in the equation \(x = ay^2 + by + c\) for the given red parabola. 

1. **Identify the vertex of the parabola**:
   - From the graph, we can see that the vertex of the parabola is at \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\).

2. **Determine the general form of the equation**:
   - The equation of the parabola is given as \(x = ay^2 + by + c\).

3. **Use the vertex to find \(c\)**:
   - At the vertex \((x, y) = (-3, 1)\), we substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     -3 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \implies -3 = a + b + c
     \]

4. **Find another point on the parabola**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c \implies 1 = c
     \]

5. **Substitute \(c\) back into the vertex equation**:
   - We already have \(c = 1\). Substitute \(c = 1\) into the vertex equation:
     \[
     -3 = a + b + 1 \implies a + b = -4
     \]

6. **Find another point to solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:
   - From the graph, another point on the parabola is \((x, y) = (1, -1)\). Substituting \(x = 1\) and \(y = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     1 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + 1 \implies 1 = a - b + 1 \implies a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]

7. **Solve the system of equations**:
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     a + b = -4
     \]
     \[
     a - b = 0 \implies a = b
     \]
   - Substitute \(a = b\) into \(a + b = -4\):
     \[
     a + a = -4 \implies 2a = -4 \implies a = -2 \implies b = -2
     \]

8. **Calculate \(a + b + c\)**:
   - We have \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 1\):
     \[
     a + b + c = -2 - 2 + 1 = -3
     \]

    <pre>To solve the problem step by step, let&#39;s analyze the given information and derive the required formula:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Bob can travel \( m \) miles in \( h \) hours.

2. **Determine Bob&#39;s Speed**:
   - Speed is defined as distance divided by time.
   - Bob&#39;s speed \( S \) is \( \frac{m}{h} \) miles per hour.

3. **Find the Time to Travel \( h \) Miles**:
   - We need to find the time \( T \) it takes for Bob to travel \( h \) miles at his current speed.
   - Using the formula \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):
     \[
     T = \frac{h}{\frac{m}{h}} = \frac{h \times h}{m} = \frac{h^2}{m}

    <pre>To solve this problem, let&#39;s denote the two integers as \( a \) and \( b \). Given the conditions:

1. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( b \) is 3.
2. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers.

We can express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 3n \]
where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime integers (i.e., gcd(m, n) = 1).

The lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) can be written as:
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \text{lcm}(3m, 3n) = 3 \cdot \text{lcm}(m, n) \]

Since \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime, their lcm is simply their product:
\[ \text{lcm}(m, n) = mn \]
Thus,
\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = 3 \cdot mn \]

According to the problem, the lcm of \( a \) and \( b \) is twelve times one of the integers. Let&#39;s assume it is twelve times \( a \):
\[ 3mn = 12a \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3m \]
\[ mn = 12m \]
\[ n = 12 \]

Now, let&#39;s check the other case where the lcm is twelve times \( b \):
\[ 3mn = 12b \]
\[ 3mn = 12 \cdot 3n \]
\[ mn = 12n \]
\[ m = 12 \]

So, we have two pairs of integers:
1. \( (a, b) = (3m, 3 \cdot 12) = (3m, 36) \)
2. \( (a, b) = (3 \cdot 12, 3n) = (36, 3n) \)

To find the largest possible sum of \( a \) and \( b \), we need to maximize \( a + b \) under the constraint that both \( a \) and \( b \) are less than 100.

For the first pair:
\[ a = 3m \]
\[ b = 36 \]
\[ a + b = 3m + 36 \]
Since \( a &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3m &lt; 100 \]
\[ m &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( m \) can be is 33:
\[ a = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 99 + 36 = 135 \]

For the second pair:
\[ a = 36 \]
\[ b = 3n \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 3n \]
Since \( b &lt; 100 \):
\[ 3n &lt; 100 \]
\[ n &lt; \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33 \]
The largest integer \( n \) can be is 33:
\[ b = 3 \cdot 33 = 99 \]
\[ a + b = 36 + 99 = 135 \]

In both cases, the largest possible sum of the two integers is 135.
