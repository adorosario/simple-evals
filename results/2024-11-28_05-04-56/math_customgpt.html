    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For coin \( A \) (3 tosses):
     - \( P(A = 0) = \binom{3}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - \( P(A = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

   - For coin \( B \) (2 tosses):
     - \( P(B = 0) = \binom{2}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
     - \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - \( P(B = 2) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where \( A &gt; B \):**
   - \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 0 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 0 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
   - \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 1 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
   - \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 0 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
   - \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 1 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
   - \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 2 \):
     - Probability = \( \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

4. **Sum the probabilities:**
   - Total probability = \( \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} \)
   - Convert to common denominator (32):
     - \( \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} \)

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For coin \( A \) (3 tosses):
     - Probability of 0 heads: \( P(A = 0) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
     - Probability of 1 head: \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - Probability of 2 heads: \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
     - Probability of 3 heads: \( P(A = 3) = \binom{3}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} \)

   - For coin \( B \) (2 tosses):
     - Probability of 0 heads: \( P(B = 0) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
     - Probability of 1 head: \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
     - Probability of 2 heads: \( P(B = 2) = \binom{2}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where the number of heads for coin \( A \) is greater than for coin \( B \):**
   - \( P(A &gt; B) \) is the sum of the probabilities of all favorable outcomes:
     - \( P(A = 1, B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 2, B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 2, B = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
     - \( P(A = 3, B = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

4. **Sum the probabilities:**
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32}
   \]
   Convert all fractions to a common denominator (32):
   \[
   P(A &gt; B) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the possible outcomes for each coin:**
   - Coin \( A \) can result in 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
   - Coin \( B \) can result in 0, 1, or 2 heads.

2. **Calculate the probabilities for each number of heads:**
   - For a fair coin, the probability of heads (H) or tails (T) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

   **Coin \( A \) (3 tosses):**
   - 0 heads: \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
   - 1 head: \( \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
   - 2 heads: \( \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
   - 3 heads: \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

   **Coin \( B \) (2 tosses):**
   - 0 heads: \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
   - 1 head: \( \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
   - 2 heads: \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

3. **Calculate the combined probabilities where coin \( A \) has more heads than coin \( B \):**
   - \( A \) has 1 head and \( B \) has 0 heads:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32}
     \]
   - \( A \) has 2 heads and \( B \) has 0 or 1 head:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \quad \text{(for 0 heads)}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \quad \text{(for 1 head)}
     \]
   - \( A \) has 3 heads and \( B \) has 0, 1, or 2 heads:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \quad \text{(for 0 heads)}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \quad \text{(for 1 head)}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \quad \text{(for 2 heads)}
     \]

4. **Sum the probabilities:**
   \[
   \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) (tossed three times) than using coin \( B \) (tossed two times).

First, let&#39;s list the possible outcomes for the number of heads for each coin:

### Coin \( A \) (tossed three times):
- Possible outcomes: 0, 1, 2, 3 heads
- Probabilities:
  - \( P(A = 0) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)
  - \( P(A = 1) = \binom{3}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
  - \( P(A = 2) = \binom{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8} \)
  - \( P(A = 3) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \)

### Coin \( B \) (tossed two times):
- Possible outcomes: 0, 1, 2 heads
- Probabilities:
  - \( P(B = 0) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)
  - \( P(B = 1) = \binom{2}{1} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
  - \( P(B = 2) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)

Next, we need to find the probability that the number of heads from coin \( A \) is greater than the number of heads from coin \( B \). We will consider all possible combinations:

1. \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 0 \)
2. \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 0 \)
3. \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 1 \)
4. \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 0 \)
5. \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 1 \)
6. \( A = 3 \) and \( B = 2 \)

We calculate the probabilities for each of these combinations:

- \( P(A = 1 \text{ and } B = 0) = P(A = 1) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
- \( P(A = 2 \text{ and } B = 0) = P(A = 2) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32} \)
- \( P(A = 2 \text{ and } B = 1) = P(A = 2) \cdot P(B = 1) = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{16} \)
- \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 0) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 0) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)
- \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 1) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 1) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16} \)
- \( P(A = 3 \text{ and } B = 2) = P(A = 3) \cdot P(B = 2) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{32} \)

Now, we sum these probabilities to get the total probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) than using coin \( B \):

\[
P(\text{more heads with } A) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{32}
\]

Converting all fractions to have a common denominator of 32:

\[
P(\text{more heads with } A) = \frac{3}{32} + \frac{3}{32} + \frac{6}{32} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{2}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

    <pre>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the number of heads from three tosses of coin \( A \) is greater than the number of heads from two tosses of coin \( B \).

First, let&#39;s list the possible outcomes for the number of heads for each coin:

### Coin \( A \) (tossed 3 times):
- Possible outcomes: 0, 1, 2, or 3 heads.
- The probabilities for each outcome can be calculated using the binomial distribution \( P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \) where \( n = 3 \) and \( p = 0.5 \).

\[
\begin{align*}
P(A = 0) &amp;= \binom{3}{0} (0.5)^0 (0.5)^3 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.125 = 0.125 \\
P(A = 1) &amp;= \binom{3}{1} (0.5)^1 (0.5)^2 = 3 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.25 = 0.375 \\
P(A = 2) &amp;= \binom{3}{2} (0.5)^2 (0.5)^1 = 3 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 0.5 = 0.375 \\
P(A = 3) &amp;= \binom{3}{3} (0.5)^3 (0.5)^0 = 1 \cdot 0.125 \cdot 1 = 0.125 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Coin \( B \) (tossed 2 times):
- Possible outcomes: 0, 1, or 2 heads.
- The probabilities for each outcome can be calculated similarly with \( n = 2 \) and \( p = 0.5 \).

\[
\begin{align*}
P(B = 0) &amp;= \binom{2}{0} (0.5)^0 (0.5)^2 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.25 \\
P(B = 1) &amp;= \binom{2}{1} (0.5)^1 (0.5)^1 = 2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \\
P(B = 2) &amp;= \binom{2}{2} (0.5)^2 (0.5)^0 = 1 \cdot 0.25 \cdot 1 = 0.25 \\
\end{align*}
\]

### Calculating the combined probabilities:
We need to find the probability that the number of heads from coin \( A \) is greater than the number of heads from coin \( B \). We will consider all possible combinations:

\[
\begin{align*}
P(A &gt; B) &amp;= P(A = 1, B = 0) + P(A = 2, B = 0) + P(A = 2, B = 1) + P(A = 3, B = 0) + P(A = 3, B = 1) + P(A = 3, B = 2) \\
&amp;= P(A = 1)P(B = 0) + P(A = 2)P(B = 0) + P(A = 2)P(B = 1) + P(A = 3)P(B = 0) + P(A = 3)P(B = 1) + P(A = 3)P(B = 2) \\
&amp;= (0.375 \cdot 0.25) + (0.375 \cdot 0.25) + (0.375 \cdot 0.5) + (0.125 \cdot 0.25) + (0.125 \cdot 0.5) + (0.125 \cdot 0.25) \\
&amp;= 0.09375 + 0.09375 + 0.1875 + 0.03125 + 0.0625 + 0.03125 \\
&amp;= 0.5 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, the probability that more heads are tossed using coin \( A \) than using coin \( B \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).
