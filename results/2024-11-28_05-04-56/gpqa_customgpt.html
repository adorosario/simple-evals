    <pre>To identify the compound, let&#39;s analyze the given data step by step:

1. **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers typically indicates the presence of an O-H stretch, which is characteristic of carboxylic acids.
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers is indicative of a C=O stretch, also characteristic of carboxylic acids.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - The absence of vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond) suggests that the compound does not contain any alkenes.
   - The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates complex splitting patterns, which are typical in molecules with multiple chiral centers and adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens.

3. **Compound Options:**
   - **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
   - **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**
   - **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
   - **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**

4. **Matching the Data:**
   - The presence of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) is confirmed by the FTIR data.
   - The complex splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum suggest the presence of multiple chiral centers and non-equivalent hydrogens.

   - **Option A (CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH)**: This compound has two ethyl groups attached to the central carbons, which would result in complex splitting patterns due to the non-equivalent hydrogens.
   - **Option B (CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH)**: This compound also has two ethyl groups attached to the central carbons, but the presence of a CH2 group adjacent to the carboxylic acid might simplify the splitting patterns.
   - **Option C (CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH)**: This compound has two methyl groups attached to the central carbons, which would result in simpler splitting patterns compared to ethyl groups.
   - **Option D (CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH)**: This compound has two methyl groups and a CH2 group, which would also result in simpler splitting patterns.

Given the complexity of the splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, the compound is more likely to be one with ethyl groups rather than methyl groups, as ethyl groups introduce more non-equivalent hydrogens and thus more complex splitting.

**Conclusion:**
The compound is most likely **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**.

   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers suggests the presence of an O-H stretch, typical of carboxylic acids.
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers indicates the presence of a C=O stretch, also typical of carboxylic acids.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - The absence of vinyl-hydrogens (no peaks in the region typically associated with vinyl groups) suggests the compound does not contain double bonds.
   - The presence of complex splitting patterns such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates a complex coupling environment, likely due to multiple adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens.

3. **Compound Structure Analysis:**
   - All given options are carboxylic acids, which is consistent with the FTIR data.
   - The complex splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum suggest the presence of multiple adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens, which is more likely in a structure with multiple branching points.

Let&#39;s evaluate each option:

A) **CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
   - This structure has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, which could lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - However, the presence of ethyl groups might simplify the splitting patterns.

B) **CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**
   - This structure has two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, which could lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - The presence of a CH2 group might simplify the splitting patterns.

C) **CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**
   - This structure has ethyl groups on adjacent carbons, which could lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - The presence of a CH2 group might simplify the splitting patterns.

D) **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
   - This structure has ethyl groups on adjacent carbons, which could lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - The presence of ethyl groups might simplify the splitting patterns.

Given the complexity of the splitting patterns described (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets), the most likely structure is one with multiple adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens, which is best represented by option A.

   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers indicates the presence of a C=O stretch, also typical of carboxylic acids.

   - The absence of vinyl-hydrogens (no peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens) suggests there are no double bonds in the compound.
   - The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates complex splitting patterns, which are characteristic of protons in a highly substituted environment.

3. **Compound Options:**
   - **A) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**
     - This compound has two methyl groups attached to the same carbon, which could lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - **B) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**
     - This compound has two ethyl groups attached to the same carbon, which could also lead to complex splitting patterns.
   - **C) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
     - This compound has ethyl groups attached to different carbons, which might not fit the observed splitting patterns.
   - **D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
     - This compound has methyl groups attached to different carbons, which might not fit the observed splitting patterns.

Given the complex splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, the most likely candidates are compounds with highly substituted environments, which are options A and B. 

Considering the broad O-H stretch and the strong C=O stretch, both A and B fit the criteria. However, the specific splitting patterns (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets) are more likely to be observed in a compound with ethyl groups due to the additional splitting caused by the extra protons in the ethyl groups.

Therefore, the most likely compound is:

    <pre>To identify the compound, let&#39;s analyze the given data step by step:

1. **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers indicates the presence of an O-H stretch, typical of carboxylic acids.
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers suggests the presence of a C=O stretch, also typical of carboxylic acids.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - The absence of vinyl-hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a carbon-carbon double bond) means the compound does not contain any C=C bonds.
   - The presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates complex splitting patterns, which are characteristic of hydrogens in a highly substituted environment.

3. **Compound Options:**
   - All given compounds are carboxylic acids, which is consistent with the FTIR data.
   - We need to match the NMR splitting patterns to the structure of the compounds.

   Let&#39;s consider each option:
   - **A) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
     - This compound has ethyl groups attached to the central carbons, which would result in complex splitting patterns due to the multiple neighboring hydrogens.
   - **B) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
     - This compound has methyl groups attached to the central carbons, which would also result in complex splitting patterns.
   - **C) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**
     - This compound has ethyl groups attached to the central carbons and a CH2 group, which would result in complex splitting patterns.
   - **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**
     - This compound has methyl groups attached to the central carbons and a CH2 group, which would result in complex splitting patterns.

Given the complexity of the splitting patterns described (doublet of triplets of quartets and doublet of triplets of triplets), the most likely candidates are those with ethyl groups, as they provide more hydrogens for complex splitting.

Therefore, the most likely compound is:

1. **FTIR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - A very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers suggests the presence of an O-H stretch, typical of carboxylic acids.
   - A strong absorption peak at 1700 wavenumbers indicates a C=O stretch, also consistent with carboxylic acids.

2. **1H NMR Spectrum Analysis:**
   - The absence of vinyl-hydrogens (no peaks in the region typically associated with vinyl groups) suggests the compound does not contain double bonds.
   - The presence of complex splitting patterns such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates a complex coupling environment, likely due to multiple adjacent protons.

3. **Compound Structure Analysis:**
   - All given compounds are carboxylic acids, which is consistent with the FTIR data.
   - The complex splitting patterns in the 1H NMR spectrum suggest the presence of multiple adjacent protons with different coupling constants.

Let&#39;s evaluate each option:

A) **CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
   - This compound has ethyl groups on the central carbon atoms, which would result in complex splitting patterns due to the different environments of the protons.

B) **CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**
   - This compound has methyl groups on the central carbon atoms and a CH2 group, which would result in simpler splitting patterns compared to the observed data.

C) **CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
   - This compound has ethyl and methyl groups on the central carbon atoms, which would result in complex splitting patterns due to the different environments of the protons.

D) **CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**
   - This compound has ethyl groups on the central carbon atoms and a CH2 group, which would result in complex splitting patterns due to the different environments of the protons.

Given the complexity of the splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, the most likely candidates are A and D, as they have multiple ethyl groups which can create the observed complex splitting patterns. However, the presence of a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets is more consistent with the environment in compound A.

   - The presence of complex splitting patterns such as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets indicates a complex coupling environment, likely due to multiple adjacent non-equivalent hydrogens.

3. **Compound Options:**

   - **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**
   - **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**
   - **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**

4. **Analysis of Each Option:**
   - **A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH**: This compound has ethyl groups which would result in complex splitting patterns in the NMR spectrum.
   - **B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH**: This compound also has ethyl groups, leading to complex splitting patterns.
   - **C) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH**: This compound has methyl groups, which would result in simpler splitting patterns compared to ethyl groups.
   - **D) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH**: This compound has methyl groups and a methylene group, which would also result in simpler splitting patterns.

Given the complexity of the splitting patterns observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, the compound is more likely to have ethyl groups rather than just methyl groups. Therefore, the most likely candidates are A and B.

Between A and B, the structure of B (CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH) fits the description better due to the presence of multiple ethyl groups leading to the observed complex splitting patterns.
