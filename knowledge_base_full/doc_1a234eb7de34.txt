Florence Nightingale David Award Most Recent Winner About the Award Current Committee Operating Procedures Nominations Past Recipients Most Recent Winner 2025 F.N. David Award Katherine B. Ensor, PhDRice University For extraordinary leadership and contributions to the statistics profession; outstanding mentorship to the next generation of statisticians and data scientists; and for excellence in collaborative team science research. Dr. Ensor will deliver the F.N. David Lecture at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. Abstract For the last two decades, I have advocated strongly for community analytics, spending much of my research and collaboration efforts in this direction to help communities understand how their residents learn, work, live, and play. With the rise of AI and the sea change in government resources, we are witnessing a change in infrastructure for science-based community decisions. This is at a time when our built infrastructure and population health require a more profound understanding to support a resilient future. What new challenges and opportunities are now present for the critical role of community analytics and the need for strong statistical science to support people and society? In honor of FN David and her work bridging advances in statistics and probability theory and the practical utility of our science, I will highlight the full spectrum of our community's contributions to today's pressing issues. Biography of Dr. Ensor Katherine Bennett Ensor is the Noah G. Harding Professor of Statistics at Rice University, where she serves as director of the Center for Computational Finance and Economic Systems (cofes.rice.edu) and co-leads the Houston Wastewater Epidemiology Program(hou-wastewater-epi.org).

Ensor, PhDRice University For extraordinary leadership and contributions to the statistics profession; outstanding mentorship to the next generation of statisticians and data scientists; and for excellence in collaborative team science research. Dr. Ensor will deliver the F.N. David Lecture at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. Abstract For the last two decades, I have advocated strongly for community analytics, spending much of my research and collaboration efforts in this direction to help communities understand how their residents learn, work, live, and play. With the rise of AI and the sea change in government resources, we are witnessing a change in infrastructure for science-based community decisions. This is at a time when our built infrastructure and population health require a more profound understanding to support a resilient future. What new challenges and opportunities are now present for the critical role of community analytics and the need for strong statistical science to support people and society? In honor of FN David and her work bridging advances in statistics and probability theory and the practical utility of our science, I will highlight the full spectrum of our community's contributions to today's pressing issues. Biography of Dr. Ensor Katherine Bennett Ensor is the Noah G. Harding Professor of Statistics at Rice University, where she serves as director of the Center for Computational Finance and Economic Systems (cofes.rice.edu) and co-leads the Houston Wastewater Epidemiology Program(hou-wastewater-epi.org).

Ensor, PhDRice University For extraordinary leadership and contributions to the statistics profession; outstanding mentorship to the next generation of statisticians and data scientists; and for excellence in collaborative team science research. Dr. Ensor will deliver the F.N. David Lecture at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. Abstract For the last two decades, I have advocated strongly for community analytics, spending much of my research and collaboration efforts in this direction to help communities understand how their residents learn, work, live, and play. With the rise of AI and the sea change in government resources, we are witnessing a change in infrastructure for science-based community decisions. This is at a time when our built infrastructure and population health require a more profound understanding to support a resilient future. What new challenges and opportunities are now present for the critical role of community analytics and the need for strong statistical science to support people and society? In honor of FN David and her work bridging advances in statistics and probability theory and the practical utility of our science, I will highlight the full spectrum of our community's contributions to today's pressing issues.

Ensor, PhDRice University For extraordinary leadership and contributions to the statistics profession; outstanding mentorship to the next generation of statisticians and data scientists; and for excellence in collaborative team science research. Dr. Ensor will deliver the F.N. David Lecture at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. Abstract For the last two decades, I have advocated strongly for community analytics, spending much of my research and collaboration efforts in this direction to help communities understand how their residents learn, work, live, and play. With the rise of AI and the sea change in government resources, we are witnessing a change in infrastructure for science-based community decisions. This is at a time when our built infrastructure and population health require a more profound understanding to support a resilient future. What new challenges and opportunities are now present for the critical role of community analytics and the need for strong statistical science to support people and society? In honor of FN David and her work bridging advances in statistics and probability theory and the practical utility of our science, I will highlight the full spectrum of our community's contributions to today's pressing issues.

Dr. Ensor will deliver the F.N. David Lecture at the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. For the last two decades, I have advocated strongly for community analytics, spending much of my research and collaboration efforts in this direction to help communities understand how their residents learn, work, live, and play. With the rise of AI and the sea change in government resources, we are witnessing a change in infrastructure for science-based community decisions. This is at a time when our built infrastructure and population health require a more profound understanding to support a resilient future. What new challenges and opportunities are now present for the critical role of community analytics and the need for strong statistical science to support people and society? In honor of FN David and her work bridging advances in statistics and probability theory and the practical utility of our science, I will highlight the full spectrum of our community's contributions to today's pressing issues. Biography of Dr. Ensor Katherine Bennett Ensor is the Noah G. Harding Professor of Statistics at Rice University, where she serves as director of the Center for Computational Finance and Economic Systems (cofes.rice.edu) and co-leads the Houston Wastewater Epidemiology Program(hou-wastewater-epi.org). Ensor served as the 2022 President of the American Statistical Association (ASA) and is currently leading the National Academy of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) committee on Frontiers of Statistics: 2035 and Beyond. She is a fellow of ASA, AAAS, and an elected member of ISI. She has been recognized for her leadership, scholarship, and mentoring, including the ASA Founder’s Award in 2024.
