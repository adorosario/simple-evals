Ethan Miller/Getty Images, FILE Morgan serves on the board of Allegiant, a low-cost airline headquartered in Las Vegas, as well as Caesars Entertainment, the casino and hotel company based in the city. Both of these organizations are sponsors of the stadium. “We’ll continue to monitor [those appointments] if there's an issue,” she said during the press conference, responding to a reporter’s question. “Obviously, those boards know that the Raiders are my first priority.” "I don't think there is an inherent conflict of interest in her [board] positions,” Mark Conrad, professor of law and ethics at Fordham University, told ABC News in a separate interview. “She is one of a number of directors of each company and as long as it is disclosed (which it clearly is), there would not be a problem. One thing she could do is to recuse herself on any vote while on the Allegiant and Caesars board of activities involving the Raiders sponsorships to avoid the appearance of impropriety. But aside from that, I do not see an issue." “I can't wait to have this new season and a full stadium at Allegiant Stadium,” Morgan told ABC News. “We're ready to go and ready to kick it off.” Related TopicsNFL Related TopicsNFL Related Topics Sponsored Content by Taboola Sponsored Content by Taboola Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMRobert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMRobert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMRobert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AM Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PM Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 18, 1:07 PM Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to know Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to know Charlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to know Sep 18, 1:07 PM Sep 18, 1:07 PM Sep 18, 1:07 PM Sep 18, 1:07 PM Video shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM Video shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM Video shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getaway Video shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getaway Video shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getaway Sep 11, 10:33 PM Sep 11, 10:33 PM Sep 11, 10:33 PM Sep 11, 10:33 PM Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PM Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PM Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate' Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate' Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate' Sep 16, 5:18 PM Sep 16, 5:18 PM Sep 16, 5:18 PM Sep 16, 5:18 PM Robert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AM Robert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AM Robert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89 Robert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89 Robert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89 Sep 16, 8:29 AM Sep 16, 8:29 AM Sep 16, 8:29 AM Sep 16, 8:29 AM ABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ABC News Live ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events
