The tour began on February 18, 2015 and ended on June 5, 2015 where she performed in 9 shows in Australasia (in New Zealand & Australia) and 19 shows in North America. Contents 1 Tour Background 2 Opening Act 3 Set List 4 Concert Dates Tour Background[] Ciara posted on her social media accounts a string of concerts in New Zealand and Australia. Those appearances marked her first performances in those territories, along with it being her first concert tour in 6 years. Although sales were strong, the opening dates of the tour proved to be disaterious. Many events were cancelled nearly minutes before the concert was to commence. Also, many spectators purchased meet & greet packages, of which Ciara did not appear. The venues blamed Ciara's management and the booking agent, Sin City Promotions. Despite the hiccups in New Zealand, concerts in Australia went smoothly. The North American tour dates were announced in March 2015 which consisted of 19 shows solely in the United States. In October, Ciara announced a second US leg to be sponsored by Topshop which included dates in Canada; these dates were later postponed to March & April 2016 and ultimately, the tour dates were cancelled. The concert in Silver Springs, Maryland was streamed live via Yahoo! Screen in partnership with Live Nation. Speaking about the tour, Ciara stated: "I am so excited about this tour. It has been almost 6 years since my last tour. I feel this album is my best body of work. It is important to me that my fans have the greatest show experience possible. On the Jackie tour, fans will get a chance to know me more intimately, jam to good music, and most importantly be entertained. I can not wait!"
