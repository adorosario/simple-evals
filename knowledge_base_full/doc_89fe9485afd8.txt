================================================================================

MINVERSE The MINVERSE function in Google Sheets returns the inverse matrix of a given square matrix. The inverse matrix is such that when multiplied by the original matrix, it results in an identity matrix. This function is commonly used in linear algebra, such as solving systems of linear equations or finding determinants of matrices. How to use MINVERSE formula? Examples of using MINVERSE formula MINVERSE formula not working? Similar formulas to MINVERSE Usage Use the MINVERSE formula with the syntax shown below, it has 1 required parameter: =MINVERSE(square_matrix) Parameters: square_matrix (required):The input square matrix for which the inverse matrix is to be computed. The matrix must be a square matrix, i.e., the number of rows must be equal to the number of columns. Examples Here are a few example use cases that explain how to use the MINVERSE formula in Google Sheets. Solving systems of linear equations The MINVERSE function can be used to find the solution to a system of linear equations represented by a matrix equation. By multiplying the inverse of the coefficient matrix with the column matrix of constants, we can obtain the column matrix of variables. Finding determinants of matrices The MINVERSE function can be used to find the determinant of a square matrix. The determinant is calculated as the product of all the diagonal elements of the inverse matrix. Inverting transformations The MINVERSE function can be used to invert a transformation matrix. By multiplying the inverse transformation matrix with the coordinates of a point, we can obtain the coordinates of the point before the transformation was applied. Common Mistakes MINVERSE not working? Here are some common mistakes people make when using the MINVERSE Google Sheets Formula: Incorrect input format One common mistake is providing an input that is not a square matrix. MINVERSE can only be used on square matrices, so ensure that the input has the same number of rows and columns. Divide by zero error Another common mistake is trying to find the inverse of a matrix that is not invertible, i.e. it has a determinant of zero. This will result in a divide by zero error. Check that the input matrix has a non-zero determinant before using MINVERSE. Incorrect function name or spelling Make sure that you have spelled the function name correctly and that it is in all caps, MINVERSE. Check for typos or other errors in the function name. Incorrect argument type Ensure that the input to the MINVERSE function is a valid array. If the input is not an array or if it is an array with non-numeric values, the function will return an error. Memory error MINVERSE is a computationally intensive function and can cause a memory error if used on very large matrices. Make sure that the input matrix is not too large for your computer to handle. Related Formulas The following functions are similar to MINVERSE or are often used with it in a formula: MMULT The MMULT formula in Google Sheets multiplies two matrices together and returns the resulting matrix. It is commonly used in linear algebra for matrix multiplication. TRANSPOSE The TRANSPOSE formula in Google Sheets allows you to flip a table of data by turning rows into columns and columns into rows. This can be useful for reorganizing data or preparing it for use in other formulas. RANK The RANK function returns the rank of a specified value within a dataset. The rank of a value is its size relative to other values in the dataset. The function can be used to determine the rank of a single value or an entire dataset. The rank can be calculated in ascending or descending order. This function is commonly used in data analysis to determine the relative position of a value within a set of values.
