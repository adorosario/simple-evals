It was an American carrier-based fighter aircraft that began service with both the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy (as the Martlet) in 1940. First used in combat by the British in Europe, the Wildcat was the only effective fighter available to the United States Navy and Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater during the early part of World War II in 1941 and 1942. With a top speed of 318 mph (512 km/h), the Wildcat was still outperformed by the faster 331 mph (533 km/h), more maneuverable, and longer ranged Mitsubishi A6M Zero. But the F4F's ruggedness made it more successful in combat. The FM Wildcat variant, built by General Motors, remained in service throughout the remainder of the war on escort carriers, where larger and heavier fighters could not be used. The inauguration of the National Museum of Naval Aviation's underwater aircraft recovery program in Lake Michigan during the early-1990s yielded a number of rare examples of Wildcats, which had crashed in the lakes waters during carrier qualification on board the training carriers Wolverine (IX 64) and Sable (IX 81). These underwater birds represent the bulk of the fourteen F4F/FM Wildcats owned by the museum. The total number of all Wildcats built varies between 7,860 and 8,061.

Displacing 1,830 cubic inches, it delivered up to 1,350 horsepower and featured a new multilayered master rod bearing to withstand stresses at higher ratings. It performed magnificently and was selected to power fighters, bombers and transports. Partly due to the urgency of World War II, 173,618 engines were produced.
