SR023 Hollins College FILES Dublin Core Title SR023 Hollins College Description When this postcard was sent, Hollins students were on a reinvigorated academic schedule that covered six days. Students could no longer attend for two years and get an “Academic Certificate.” They now must complete all four years. These academic changes were the results of the school’s visionary president, Matty Cocke, who served from 1901 until 1933. “Hollins with its comfortable special courses is no more; we have become a more exact college,” noted a student reporter in 1909.
