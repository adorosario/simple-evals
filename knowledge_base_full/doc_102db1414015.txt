In all, he landed eight songs in the year-end Hot 100 and an incredible SIX albums on the chart’s 200 best sellers of the year. Taylor Swift’s reputation was the #1 album of the year and her 1989 showed up at #82. It wasn’t a good singles year for Swift though, with only Delicate cracking the Hot 100 chart at #24. Cardi B earned seven spots on the Hot 100 and one on the Billboard 200 with her debut album Invasion of Privacy. Post Malone popped six times; four songs and two albums. He is the only artist to have two albums in the year-end top 10 with beerbongs & bentleys (#3) and Stoney (#8). Drake, Cardi B and Post Malone all earned two spots in the Hot 100 top 10. Two soundtracks made waves this year: The Greatest Showman at #4 and Black Panther at #12.

This led him down the path to obsessing about awards. Much later, he found himself in film school and the film forums of GoldDerby, and then migrated over to the former Oscarwatch (now AwardsDaily), before breaking off to create AwardsWatch in 2013.He is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, accredited by the Cannes Film Festival, Telluride Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival and more, is a member of the International Cinephile Society (ICS), The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics (GALECA), Critics Choice Association (CCA), San Francisco Bay Area Film Critics Circle (SFBAFCC) and the International Press Academy. Among his many achieved goals with AwardsWatch, he has given a platform to underrepresented writers and critics and supplied them with access to film festivals and the industry and calls the Bay Area his home where he lives with his husband and son.
