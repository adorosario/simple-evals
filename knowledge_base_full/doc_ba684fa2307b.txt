I don't know why this is so, but there is some logic in Europe and South America, as they are the zones that bring most of both countries (13+5) and most referees (10+6).00:59 Champions League is BACK ðŸ¤©TOP NEWS2025 NFL Week 3 Expert PicksBleacher Report12hPower Rankings at the Start of Training Camp ðŸ“ŠBleacher Report12hRookies That Already Look Like StealsBleacher Report11h1 Dream Trade for Jays ðŸ”„Bleacher Report1dKD Lost Bitcoin Password ðŸ˜‚Bleacher Report3hTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Reportâ€¢3hA'ja Wilson, Alanna Smith Make History as 2025 WNBA Co-Defensive Players of the YearBleacher Reportâ€¢4hYankees vs. Blue Jays 2026 London Series Canceled by MLB Due to Scheduling Issues2026 matchup between Yankees and Blue Jays no longer happening due to scheduling issues (AP)Bleacher Reportâ€¢5hLeBron James Says He's 'Not Hinting' at Anything amid Lakers, NBA Retirement RumorsBleacher Reportâ€¢12hBiggest Week 3 Fantasy Football 2025 Sleepers at Every PositionBleacher Reportâ€¢5hAngel Reese's 1st Reebok Signature Shoe Sells out Hours After Going on SaleReese posts after two colorways fly off shelves ðŸ“¸TRENDING ON B/RBleacher Reportâ€¢3hA'ja Wilson, Alanna Smith Make History as 2025 WNBA Co-Defensive Players of the YearBleacher Reportâ€¢4hYankees vs. Blue Jays 2026 London Series Canceled by MLB Due to Scheduling Issues2026 matchup between Yankees and Blue Jays no longer happening due to scheduling issues (AP)Bleacher Reportâ€¢5hLeBron James Says He's 'Not Hinting' at Anything amid Lakers, NBA Retirement RumorsBleacher Reportâ€¢12hBiggest Week 3 Fantasy Football 2025 Sleepers at Every PositionBleacher Reportâ€¢5hAngel Reese's 1st Reebok Signature Shoe Sells out Hours After Going on SaleReese posts after two colorways fly off shelves ðŸ“¸ 2010 FIFA World Cup: Referees for the World CupJon SainzJun 6, 2018Everybody knows who the players for his national team are, and at least the stars for other teams, specially the favourites, but who knows who the referees are?

Since the article since here has been just a list (and the boring type of those), I'm going to give you some fun facts, that may or may not interest you. Uruguay, New Zealand, and Mexico are the only countries that have more than one referee representing them (not including assistants), with two referees each.
