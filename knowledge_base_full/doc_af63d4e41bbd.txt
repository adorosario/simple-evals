The Court held that the subject matter of the Act is housing and that it falls within the concurrent competence of national and provincial legislature. Therefore, the Act as a whole is not invalid. The Court however found that section 16 of the Act is unconstitutional because it compels an owner of a building or land, or the municipality within whose jurisdiction the building or land is located, to institute eviction proceedings against unlawful occupiers even in circumstances where the requirements of Prevention of Illegal Evictions and Unlawful Occupations Act 19 of 1998, which protects unlawful occupiers against arbitrary evictions, may not be met. It also found that the power given to the MEC to issue a notice is overbroad and irrational because it applies to any unlawful occupier on any land or in any building even if it is not a slum and was not properly related to the purpose of the Act being the elimination or prevention of slums. The majority therefore granted an order declaring section 16 of the Act inconsistent with section 26 of the Constitution and invalid. Majority: Moseneke DCJ (Langa CJ, Cameron J, Mokgoro J, Ngcobo J, Nkabinde J, O?Regan J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J and Van der Westhuizen J concurring).
