Loop News Bids the Caribbean a Grateful Goodbye They say all good things must come to an end and so it is, that after 11 years of proudly serving the Caribbean as a trusted media partner, Loop News is today announcing the end of our operations. We’re proud of what we have achieved and of the people who came on the journey with us. Since our inception, Loop has become a trusted source of news, winning several awards and building a passionate, engaged community of readers and viewers. As we reflect on over a decade of journalism and community impact, we are deeply grateful for the relationships we have built and the stories we have told. This decision marks the end of an era. While it wasn’t an easy choice, we believe it is the right one for this moment. We would like to say thank you for the incredible support we have received from our readers and viewers across the Caribbean and beyond over the years and are deeply honoured to have been a part of your daily lives. Walk good.
