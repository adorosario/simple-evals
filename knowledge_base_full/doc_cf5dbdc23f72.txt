Codrington’s wealth derived principally from sugar plantations established and developed by his father and grandfather in Antigua, Barbados, and Barbuda. These plantations were worked by slaves. He was educated at Oxford and became a Fellow of All Souls in 1690. The sculpture is a variant of Cheere’s figure for the tomb of the 1st Duke of Ancaster at Edenham, Lincolnshire which was erected in 1728. This work was produced at a cost of £148 9s 6d.
