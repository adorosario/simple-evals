He was a founding editorial board member for Educational Studies in Mathematics (1968-78) and wrote a number of books and monographs with teachers in mind (for example, the ATM monograph on Topology). Brian, along with Geoffrey Howson, pioneered work on the relationship between mathematics and society; their book “Mathematics: society and curricula” remains important. At Southampton, Brian pioneered and supported the development of undergraduate mathematics options that were influential in undergraduate mathematics education nationally and internationally. Above all, Brian was a supremely nice person always willing to share his expertise. Brian contributed significantly to mathematics education and will be sadly missed.
