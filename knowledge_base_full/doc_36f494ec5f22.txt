Joe de Larios go to album Celebrantsby Nickel Creek supported by 55 fans who also own “Laysongs” Musical maturity doesn't have to mean stodgy rehashed tunes.

Bandcamp New & Notable Oct 23, 2021 go to album Wealth of Sorrowby Cahalen Morrison Bright and skipping songs that foreground the sound of the banjo and fingerstyle guitar in music that feels timeless. Bandcamp New & Notable Oct 5, 2020 go to album Live at Club 47by Doc Watson A partnership between Yep Roc and The Southern Folklife Collection, the LP features a never-before-heard live performance by Doc Watson. Bandcamp New & Notable Jan 16, 2018 go to album Age of Apathyby Aoife O'Donovan supported by 39 fans who also own “Laysongs” The instrumentation and songwriting in this album is really top-tier. Aofie is one of my favorite folk/alt-country artists and she performs wonderfully, bringing her unique tone of voice to this project. This album was my first step into Aofie's artistry, and is firmly one of my favorite albums. rileyridgway go to album music merch community Laysongs by Chris Thile supported by sherryking sherryking Chris in a church!!
