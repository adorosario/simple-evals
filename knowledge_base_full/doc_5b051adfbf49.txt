The pulsar orbits with a brown dwarf companion, which has an orbital period of 9.2 hours, with an eclipse duration of approximately 20 minutes. When it was discovered it was the first such pulsar known. The prevailing theoretical explanation for the system implied that the companion is being destroyed by the gravitational environment ("Roche lobe overflow") caused by the neutron star, and so the nickname "black widow" was applied to this pulsar. Subsequent to this, other objects with similar features have been discovered and the name has been applied to a class of millisecond pulsars with an ablating companion. Later observations of the object showed a bow shock in H-alpha and a smaller-in-extent shock seen in X-rays (as observed by the Chandra Space Telescope), indicating a forward velocity of approximately a million kilometers per hour. In 2010, it was estimated that the neutron star's mass was at least 1.66 Solar mass, possibly as high as 2.4 Solar mass (which, if true, would surpass PSR J1614-2230 as the most massive neutron star that has been found, and would place it within the range of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.)
