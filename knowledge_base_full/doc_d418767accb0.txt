Let Kbe a compact analytic surface, i.e. a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 2. Let (V) be the field of all meromorphic functions on V and denote by dim .Jt (V) the degree of transcendency of (V) over the field C of all complex numbers. By a result due to Chow [2] and Siegel [9], we have dim J((V) <; 2. We denote by p„(V) the geometric genus of V, by C the first Chern class of 1 V and by cf(V) the value of c\ = C · C on the fundamental 4-cycle V. 1 1 The geometric genus p (V) is, by definition, the number of linearly inde­ g pendent holomorphic 2-forms on V. By the canonical bundle K of V we mean the complex line bundle over V of forms of type (2, 0). We note that the characteristic class c(K) of K is equal to -C . 1 THEOREM 1. (Chow and Kodaira [3], Kodaira [6].) A compact analytic surface V is a non-singular algebraic surface imbedded in a projective space if and only if dim JK ( V) = 2. Let Δ be a non-singular algebraic curve (i.e. a compact Riemann surface). We say that V is an analytic fibre space of curves of genus π over Δ if there exists a holomorphic map Φ of V onto Δ such that the inverse image C = Φ_1(Μ) of any "general point" Μ of Δ is a non-singular u irreducible curve of genus π, and we call Φ the canonical projection of V onto Δ, the inverse image Φ_1(Μ) of each point u e Δ a fibre of V. In what follows we are mainly concerned with analytic fibre spaces of elliptic curves i.e. curves of genus 1. THEOREM 2. (Kodaira [6].) If dim .Ji(V) = 1, then V is an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over a curve Δ and the canonical projection Φ : V —>• Δ induces an isomorphism Φ* : Ji(V) 2, where JK(IS) denotes the field of meromorphic functions on Δ. Moreover V contains no irreducible curve other than the components of the fibres of V. 121 ( 51 ) 1142 KUNIHIKO KODAIRA We denote by (CD) the intersection multiplicity of two curves C and D on Vand write (C2) for (CC). A curve C on V will be called an exceptional curve (of the the first kind) if C is a non-singular rational curve with (C2) = — 1 (compare Zariski [10], pp. 36-41. By an exceptional curve we mean always an exceptional curve of the first kind). For an arbitrary point pe V we denote by Q the quadratic transformation with the center ρ (see Hopf p [5]). Moreover we call any surface W — . Q Q Q (V) obtained from ils vi lll V by applying a finite number of quadratic transformations a quadratic transform of V. We recall that 5 = Q Jp) is an exceptional curve on the quadratic transform V = Q (V) and that Q 1 is a holomorphic map of V v fl onto V which is biregular between V-S and V — p. Moreover Q~x induces an isomorphism: Jt( Q(V)) ^ Jt(V). v THEOREM 3. Assume that dim -Jf(V) > 1. If V contains an exceptional curve S, then there exists a compact analytic surface W and a point pe W such that V — Q (W) and S = Q(p). v v This theorem has been established for algebraic surfaces by Castelnuovo and Enriques [1] (compare also Kodaira [7]). In view of Theorem 1, it suffices therefore to consider the case in which dim Jf(V) = 1. Now, if dim Jf(V) — 1, Fis an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over a curve Δ and the canonical projection Φ maps S onto a single point u on Δ. Let U be a small neighborhood of u on Δ. A detailed analysis of the structure of the fibre space V shows that the neighborhood Φ_1(ί/) of S can be imbedded in an algebraic surface. Hence the theorem is reduced to the case of algebraic surfaces. As to compact analytic surfaces with no meromorphic functions except constants, we have the following THEOREM 4. (Kodaira [6].) Let V be a compact Kahler surface with dim Jf(V) = 0. The geometric genus p(V) of V is equal to 1 and the first g Betti number b( V) of V is equal to either 4 or 0. Ifb(V) — 4, then V is a } 1 quadratic transform of a complex torus (of complex dimension 2). If 6( V) = X 0 and if V contains no exceptional curve, then the canonical bundle K of V is trivial and the second Betti number b (V) of V is equal to 22. 2 It can be shown that c'f( V) <ΐ 0 if K is an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over a curve, while, with the help of Riemann-Roch's theorem, we infer readily that dim Ji(V) 1> 1 ifp(V) I> 1 and if cf(V) > 0. Hence we g obtain from Theorems 1, 2, and 4 the following THEOREM 5. If V is a compact Kahler surface and if c\(V) > 0, then V is an algebraic surface. 2. Let V be an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over a curve Δ having no exceptional curve and let Φ be the canonical projection of V onto Δ. For an arbitrary point ae Δ, we denote by τ the local uniform- α ization variable on Δ with the center a and by r(w) the value of τ at a 0 α 122 ί 51) 1143 ON COMPACT ANALYTIC SURFACES point u in a neighborhood of a on A. Moreover we denote by (z z) a u 2 system of local coordinates on V. Now, if (1) at each point z on , we call a regular fibre of V. Clearly each regular fibre C is a non-singular elliptic curve. By a theorem of u Bertini, there exists a finite set {a } of points a, p = 1,2, 3, ., on A such p p that is a regular fibre for each point In this sec- tion we assume that the fibres are not regular. Clearly is a holomorphic function defined on a neighborhood of which vanishes at each point on By the singular fibre of V over a we mean the divisor of the holomorphic function p We write each singular fibre in the form where 0 are irreducible curves and n are positive integers. Clearly pg ps <P_1(fl ) coincides with the union of the curves Q ; thus C may be con- () ps a sidered as the inverse image of a attached with the proper multiplicities n . p ps The expression may be regarded as a 2-cycle on the polyhedron By the type of the singular fibre we mean the topological structure of the polyhedron <J)_i(a ) together with P the homology class of the 2-cycle on It is not difficult to determine all possible types of singular fibres of V. We denote these types by the symbols II, II*, III, III*, IV, IV*. In order to describe the characteristic properties of each type (see Figure 1), we write for and denote by the intersection cycle of 0, and 0. t For instance the formula indicates that 0 and 0 S ( meet at two points p and p with intersection multiplicities 2 and 3, x 2 respectively. I : w h e re 0 is a non-singular elliptic curve. TO 0 O Ij : , where 0 is a rational curve with one m O ordinary double point. I : ., where 0 and 0 are non- m 2 O X singular rational curves with II : is a rational curve with one cusp. III : where 0 and 0 are non-singular rational curves O 1 with IV : where are non-singular rational curves and The singular fibres of the types I*, II*, III*, IV* arecomposedof non-singular rational curves in such a way that 1 (i.e. 0 and Q have at most one simple intersection point) for s < t S t 123 ( 51 ] 1144 KUNIHIKO KODAIRA and 0, n 0 n 0 is empty for r < s < t.

A singular fibre Cap = L nps0 p8 will be called simple or multiple accord s ing as min {nps} = 1 or >2. It is clear that Cap is a multiple singular fibre > < < /, if and only if Cap is of type mlb, m 2. Suppose that Cap' 1 p are of types "'/bp' mp > 2, respectively, and that Cap' P > 1+ 1, are simple. Let mo be the I.c.m. of m 1, •.. , mp' . , mZ, and let d = m 1m 2 ..• mz' More over let ao be an arbitrary point on ~ - {aJ Then there exists ad-fold abelian covering surface Zi of ~ which is unramified over ~ - {ao, aI' . , az} and has dlmp branch points bpk, k = 1,2, . , dlmp of order mp - lover each point a p' P = 0, 1, 2, . , I. Letting 1lT be the canonical projection of Zi onto ~, we define the analytic fibre space V over Zi inducedfrom V by the map to be the minimal non-singular model of the subvariety of 1lT V X Zi consisting of all points (z, u) E V X Zi satisfying <1>(z) = 1lT(u). The canonical projection d>: V -+ Zi is induced from the projection V X Zi -+ Zi. V is also an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves. It is clear that, for U =1= b pk' the fibre C:u of V over u has the same type as the fibre C of V over u = 1lT(u) and, in particular, C:u is regular if 1lT(u) 1= {a while thu e fibre C b pk' 1 < P < t, is of type 11m pb p and C b Ok is regular. Thp u} s, the induced fibre space V is free from multiple singular fibres. On the other hand V is a d-fo1d abelian covering manifold of V which is unrami fied over V - C ao and has dlmo branch curves C b u ,k = 1,2, . , dlmo, of order mo - lover Ca. The covering map II : V -+ V is induced from _ 0 the projection V X ~ -+ V. Thus we obtain the following THEOREM 6. An analytiC fibre space V of elliptic curves over a curve ~ having no exceptional curve induces over a suitably chosen finite ramified 124 ( 51 J 1145 ON COMPACT ANALYTIC SURFACES abelian covering surface Δ of Δ an analytic fibre space V of elliptic curves free from multiple singular fibres. V is a finite abelian covering of V having branch curves over a regular fibre C„ of V and contains no exceptional o curve. V is represented as the factor space: V = Vj(5, where (5 is the covering transformation group of V over V. 3. Now let V be an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over Δ having neither exceptional curve nor multiple singular fibre and let Φ : V —>- Δ be FIGURE 1 IV 11 II* in* IV* Each line represents Θ ; the integers attached to the line gives /J . ρ8 ps 125 [ 51 ] 1146 KUNIHIKO KODAIRA the canonical projection. Moreover let {a be a finite set of points p} a1, . , a p' . , G r on L\ such that the fibre C" = <1>-1(U) is regular for u =/0 a p and let L\' = L\ - {a where, for convenience, we do not assume that p}, each fibre Co is singular. Co is therefore either a regular fibre or a singular P P fibre of one of the types Ill' I:, II, Il*, III, IIl*, IV, IV*, where we write Ib for 1 lb' The restriction V I L\' = <1>-1( L\') = U "E~' C" of V to L\' is a differentiable fibre bundle of tori over L\' and therefore the first homology groups H1 (C u' Z)(:::::: Z ffi Z) of the fibres C" with coefficients in the integers Z forms a locally constant sheaf G' = U"E~' H1(C u' Z) over L\' in a canonical manner. Let Ep be a circular neighborhood of ap on L\ and let E; = Ep - ap' Then the group reG' I E;) of sections of G' E; E;. over is independent of the size of We extend G' to a sheaf Gover L\ by defining reG' I E;) to be the stalk G a p of Gover a p: G = U pG a pU G', Ga p = r( G' I Ep') and we call G the homological invariant of the fibre space V over L\. We denote by J(w) the elliptic modular fu.nction defined on the upper half plane C+ = {w I ~w > o}. As is well known, w ~J(w) is a holo morphic map of C+ onto the whole plane C and the equality J(w) = J(w') holds if and only if w' is obtained from w by a modular transformation , aw+b S:w~w =---, ad- bc = I, cw+d where a, b, c, d are rational integers. For each point u E L\', we represent the elliptic curve C u as a complex torus with periods (w(u), 1), ~w(u) > 0, and set feu) = J(w(u)). w(u) is determined by C uniquely up to a modular transformation and u depends holomorphically on u E L\'. Hence feu) is a single-valued holomorphic function of u defined on L\' = Ll - {ap}. Moreover it can be shown that each point a is either a pole or a removable singular point p of feu). Thus feu) is a meromorphic function on L\. We call feu) the functional invariant of the fibre space V of elliptic curves over L\.

Then there exists one and only one multi-valued holomorphic function ro(u) with 126 ( 51) 1147 ON COMPACT ANALYTIC SURFACES on A' satisfying Take a pointo on A' and suppose that each element of the fundamental group of A' is represented by a closed arc ft on A' starting and ending at o. By the analytic continuation along the arc fi, co(u) is transformed into Sj»(U), where is a modular transformation depending only on the homotopy class of ft relative to o.

It can be shown that, given an analytic fibre space V of elliptic curves over A free from multiple singular fibres, the homological invariant G of V belongs to the functional invariant f(u) of V.

The family contains one and only one fibre space B which has a global holomorphic section over A. We note that the fibre space B is an algebraic surface. Let & and M be complex manifolds. We say that & is an analytic fibre space over M free from singular fibres if there is a holomorphic map Y of onto M such that, at each point on <S, the rank of the Jacobian of Y is equal to the dimension of M. DEFINITION 2. Let <g be an analytic fibre space over M free from singular fibres such that each fibre is a complex Lie group whose complex structure is that of the complex submanifold of 'S. u Let 3> be the complex submanifold of % / consisting of all points (gi, g) e & X rS satisfying will be called an analytic 2 fibre system of complex Lie groups over M if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) u—>\ is a holomorphic map of M into rS, where 1„ u denotes the unit of . (ii) (g g) -^-gi • gf1 is a holomorphic map of 2 u lt 2 onto <3. Now we consider the fibre space We denote the canonical projection B-+ A by *F and one of the global holomorphic sections of B by o u —o(u). Each fibre C = Y^w), u e A'; of B is a. complex u torus. The canonical additive group structure on a complex torus is determined uniquely by giving the position of the unit 0. We choose the additive group structure on each complex torus C such that the unit 0 u coincides with o(u). Then the subspace B' = B | A' = Y^CA') of B forms an analytic fibre system of complex Lie groups over A' in the sense of the above Definition 2. We denote by Bt the open subset of B consisting of all points z satisfying (compare (1)). Clearly we have where The fibre is written in the form where denotes the sum extended over all s for which n = 1. pS If C is regular, then otherwise each component a is (analytically homeomorphic to) either C or C*. 129 ( 51 ] 1150 KVN1H1K0 KODAIRA PROPOSITION 1. The analytic fibre space Bs over A has a unique structure of analytic fibre system of complex abelian Lie groups which is an extension of the structure of analytic fibre system of complex Lie groups on B'. The group structures of the fibres of B' are given in Table I. Let E be an arbitrary open domain on A and let < be holomorphic sections of B" over E. Then, by Proposition 1, «->- is also a holomorphic section of Bf over E, where + or — denotes the group operation on each fibre of B*. Thus the space r(5; | E) of holomorphic sections of B% over E forms an additive group in a canonical manner and therefore the sheaf over A of germs of holomorphic sections of B" is defined. We denote this sheaf by For any holomorphic section of Bi over E, is a fibre preserving analytic homeomorphism of B* | E onto B' \ E. PROPOSITION 2. L*(<p) \ B~ \ E B' \ E can be extended uniquely to a fibre preserving analytic homeomorphism L(cp) of B \ E onto B \ E. In view of this proposition, Q(B') may be regarded as a sheaf of structure groups acting on the fibre space B (compare Grothendieck [4]). We consider the first cohomology of A with coefficients in the sheaf Q(B$). Given an element , let {E,) be a sufficiently fine covering of A and let be a 1-cocycle on the nerve of the covering {E} representing the cohomology s class a. DEFINITION 3.

Hence we obtain the exact sequence (3) . ~ HO(t!,.,F) ~ H1(!J., D.(Be» ~ HI(t!,., .o(B~» ~ O. For an element (f of Hl(t!,., D.(B~» we define Ba in the same manner as in Definition 3. In view of (3), we obtain from Theorem 9 the following THEOREM 10. The family :F(/, G) consists of at! fibre spaces BO, (f E HI(t!,., D.(B~». The notions of fibre spaces and their equivalences depend on the sheaf of structure groups (compare Grothendieck [4]). We mean by a 3-fibre space a fibre space with the sheaf of structure groups 3 and we say that two fibre spaces are 3-equivalent if they are equivalent as 3-fibre spaces. V = BO, (f E Hl(ll, D.(B~», may be considered as an analytic fibre space, as an D.(B~)-fibre space, or as an D.(B~)-fibre space, and the element (f E HI(1l n(Bg» represents the D.(Bg)-equivalence class of BO. 4. Clearly the fibre cg" of Bg over u is given by for u E t!,.', foru=a p' e where e~ po is isomorphic to C C*, or a complex torus if a p is regular (compare Table I). Let fu be the tangent space of cg" at o(u). Then f= U L forms a complex line bundle over t!,. in a canonical manner. Since t may cg" be regarded as the infinitesimal group of the complex Lie group which is isomorphic to a complex tOfUS, C, or C*, we have a canonical homo morphism It follows that there is a locally biregular holomorphic map h : f~B6 whose restriction to each fibre L coincides with h". Clearly h induces a homomorphism: D.(f) ~ D.(Bt) of the sheaf D.m of holomorphic sections of f onto the sheaf D.(Bg). We denote this homomorphism by the same symbol h. PROPOSITION 3. We have the exact sequence (4) where G is the homological invariant of the fibre space B. We obtain from (4) the corresponding exact cohomology sequence h* 15* (5) . ~ HI(Il, G) ~ HICt!,., D.(m --+ HlCt!,., D.(Bg») --+ H2(t!,., G) -+0. 131 ( 51 J 1152 KUNIHIKO KODAIRA We define c(a) = o*(a), for a E H1(!1, D.(B8)). Let Am and A(BS) be the sheaves over Ll of differentiable sections of T and B6, respectively. A(Bg) is a sheaf of structure groups acting on B considered as a differentiable fibre space. From the exact commutative diagram o --. G --. D.m --.0.( Bg) --.0 II '~ '~ 0--. G --.Am --.A(B8) --.0, where t denotes the inclusion map, we obtain the exact commutative diagram --. HI(Ll, D.(D) --. HI(Ll, D.(Bg») --. H2(Ll, G)--.O ~ ,* ~ II o ) H1(Ll,A(Bg»--.H2(Ll,G)--.0 This shows that c(a) represents the A(Bg)-equivalence class of the fibre space B" over Ll. In particular we have THEOREM II. If c(a) = c(1]), then the fibre spaces B" and B'I are differen tiab~y equivalent. We call c( a) the characteristic class of the D.(Bg)-fibre space B" over Ll. By a complex analytic family of compact complex manifolds we mean the family {Vt I t EM} of fibres Vt = 1T-l(t) of an analytic fibre space j/ free from singular fibres over a connected complex manifold M whose fibres are compact, where 1T is the canonical projection 1/" -+ M (see Kodaira and Spencer [8]). Moreover we say that a compact complex manifold W is a (complex analytic) deformation of Vif Wand V belong to one and the same complex analytic family. It is clear that any deformation Wof V is differentiably homeomorphic to V. THEOREM 12. {B,,+h*(t) It E Hl(Ll, D.(D)}forms a complex analyticfami~ of compact complex manifolds, where a is an element of Hl(Ll, D.(B5». We remark here that Hl(Ll, D.(t)) has a canonical structure of complex vector space. We set ''f/(c) = {B"+h*(t) It E Hl(Ll, D.m)}, c = c(a). In view of (5), the family j/(c) is composed of all fibre spaces BII, C(ll) = c, with repetitions. Hence we have THEOREM I3. If C(1]) = c(a), then B'I is a deformation of Ba • It is clear that the projection <P: B" --. Ll induces an isomorphism > <P* of 1(Ll) into 1(BO) and therefore dim 1(BO) I. Using the fact that, if dim 1(BO) = I, B" contains no irreducible curve other than the components of the fibres (see Theorem 2), we obtain the following THEOREM 14. B" is an algebraic surface if and only if a is an element of finite order of Hl(!l, D.(Bg». 132 ( 51) 1153 ON COMPACT ANALYTIC SURFACES Combining this with Theorem 13, we get THEOREM 15. If C( 0) is an element offinite order of H2(!1, G), then BO is a deformation of an algebraic surface. 5. We denote by c(f) the characteristic class of the complex line bundle f over Ll. In view of the canonical isomorphism: H2( Ll, Z) '" Z, we may cm suppose that is an integer. Moreover we denote by yeT) the number of the singular fibres of B of type T and by j the order of the meromorphic function ,leu), i.e. the total multiplicities of the zeros of ,leu). PROPOSITION 4. 0 = -c(f) is given by 120 = j + 6 Ibv(m + 2v(II) + IOv(1l *) + 3v(lII) + + + 9v(1ll *) 4v(IV) 8v(IV*). This proposition shows, in particular, that c(f) < 0 and that c(f) = 0 if and only if B has no singular fibre and ,leu) is reduced to a constant. By using Riemann-Roch's theorem we obtain (6) dim HI( /1, Q(m = {\p - 1 + b, p, where p is the genus of Ll. PROPOSITION 5. H2(Ll, G) is a finite abelian group, provided that G is not trivial. It is clear that, if G is the trivial sheaf Z 8j Z, H2(/1, G) is isomorphic to Z 8jZ. Now we consider an arbitrary fibre space V = Ba, (J E Hl(/1, Q(Bt)), belonging to Y;(f, G). Let 1 be the canonical bundle of /1. THEOREM 16. The canonical bundle K of V is induced from 1 - t by the projection <I> of V onto Ll : K = <1>*(1 - f). Combining this with (6), we infer that the geometric genus p,(V) is given by p {p - + if f:f: 0, (V) = 1 b, 9 p, if f = o. THEOREM 17. The Euler number c 2(V) of V is given by C2(V) = 120. An analytic fibre space V of (elliptic) curves over Ll is called an analytic I fibre bundle if each point u Ell has a neighborhood Eu such that V Eu = Eu X C" in the complex analytic sense. It can be shown that, if G is trivial, B is analytically trivial i.e. B = Ll X Co in the complex analytic sense and therefore V = Ba is an analytic principal bundle of elliptic curves, i.e. an analytic fibre bundle over Ll whose fibre is a non-singular elliptic curve Co and whose structure group is the translation group acting on Co. We infer from Proposition 5 and Theorem 14 that, in case G is not trivial, each complex analytic family ny(1') contains an algebraic surface. Hence we obtain THEOREM 18. An analytic fibre space V of elliptic curves over a curve Ll 133 ( 51 J 1154 KUNIHIKO KODAIRA free from exceptional curves andfrom multiple singular fibres is a deformation of an algebraic surface unless V is an analytic principal bundle of elliptic curees. Since the group Hl(I1, G) is finitely generated, we infer from (5) and Theorem 14 the following THEOREM 19. If G is not trivial and if dim HV:J., Q(m» 1, the general member of each complex analytic family 1/«) is not algebraic, or, more precisely, the member Ba+h*(t) of1/'(c) is algebraic if and only if t belongs to a countable subset of HI(b., Q(f)). In case G is trivial, each family 1/(c), c 0/= 0, contains no algebraic surface. The family 1/(0) contains the algebraic surface B = b. x Co, but, > if dim HI(b., Q) 1, the general member of 1/(0) is not algebraic. 6. Now we consider an arbitrary compact analytic surface V with dim ..A'(V) = 1. By Theorems 3 and 2, V is a quadratic transform of an analytic fibre space W of elliptic curves over a curve b. o containing no exceptional curve. By Theorem 6, W is represented in the form W = W/(f), where W is an analytic fibre space of elliptic curves over a finite ramified covering Lio of b.o free from multiple singular fibres. Let b. = Lio. Then, by Theorem 10, W has the form Ba , a E HI(b., Q(BS». Thus we obtain THEOREM 20. Every compact analytic surface V with dim ..A'(V) = 1 is represented in the form V = '" QPaQP2QP1(B"/(f), a E HI(b., Q(Bg», where (f) is a finite abelian group of analytic automorphisms of Ba introduced in Theorem 6. An analytic fibre space V of elliptic curves over b. containing no excep tional curve will be called an analytic quasi-bundle of elliptic curves if each I singular fibre C of V is of type mIo, m depending on p, and if V b.' is an a p analytic principal bundle of elliptic curves over b.' = b. - {a It can p}. be shown that W = W/(f) is an analytic quasi-bundle of elliptic curves over b.o if and only if W = Ba is an analytic principal bundle of elliptic curves over Lio = b.. Suppose that W = Ba is not an analytic principal bundle of elliptic curves. Let X be the underlying differentiable manifold on which the complex structure Ba is defined and consider (f) as a group of differentiable automorphisms of X. By a detailed analysis of the structures of the auto morphisms of (f), we infer that there exists a linear subspace M of HI(b., Q(m satisfying the following two conditions: (i) The complex analytic I family {Ba+h*(t) t E M} contains an algebraic surface, (ii) The auto morphisms of (f) are biregular with respect to each complex analytic structure Ba+h*(t), t EM, defined on X. Letting V = . QPaQp2Qp/Ba+h*U)/(f)), t I we obtain a complex analytic family {VI t E M} of deformations V t of Vo = V which contains an algebraic surface. Thus we obtain 134 ( 51 J 1155 ON COMPACT ANALYTIC SURFACES > THEOREM 21. A compact analytic surface V with dim Jt(V) 1 is a deformation of an algebraic surface unless V is a quadratic transform of an analytic quasi-bundle of elliptic curves over a curve. In case W = B" is an analytic principal bundle of elliptic curves, it can be shown that, if V = . Qp2Qp.(B"/(f») has a Kahler metric, V is a deformation of an algebraic surface. Combining this with Theorem 21, we obtain THEOREM 22. Every compact Kahler surface having at least one non constant meromorphicfunction is a deformation of an algebraic surface. Now we consider a compact Kahler surface V with dim Jt(V) = o. If the first Betti number b(V) of V is positive, then, by Theorem 4, Vis a 1 quadratic transform of a complex torus, and therefore V is a deformation of an algebraic surface. Combining this with the above Theorem 22, we obtain THEOREM 23. Every compact Kahler surface V with the first Betti number b(V) > 0 is a deformation of an algebraic surface. 1 REFERENCES [I) G.

KODAIRA (Received June 30, 1959) The present paper is the first part of a study of structures of compact complex analytic surfaces. The main results of this study were announced in a short note' which will serve as an introduction to this paper. Natural ly that note, written two years ago, does not cover some recent results among which the following would be worth mentioning here: Every compact Kahler surface is a deformation of an algebraic surface. This result was conjectured earlier by Sir William Hodge.2 1. Exact sequences First we fix our notations. We denote by Va compact complex analytic surface. By a complex line bundle F over V we mean an analytic fibre bundle over V whose fibre is a complex line C and whose structure group is the multiplicative group C* of complex numbers acting on C. The bundle F can be described as follows: Let {U be a sufficiently fine finite J} covering of V and let 'tiJ' be the canonical projection of F onto V. Then the inverse image 'tiJ'-l(U J) has a product structure: 'tiJ'-l(U J) = U J X C, and (z, ~ J) EO U X C is identical with (z, ~~) E Ule X C if and only if ~ J = J fJIe(z) • S where fJ.(z) is a non-vanishing holomorphic function defined Ie, on UJ n Ule. Under these circumstances, we say that the bundle F is defined by the system {fJk} of the transition functions fJIe = fJIe(z), and we call ~J the fibre coordinate of the point (z, SJ) on F over the neighbor hood U We identify two complex line bundles which are analytically j• equivalent. For any pair of complex line bundles F, F' determined respec + tively by {fJIe}, {f~Ie}' we define the sum F" = F F' to be the complex = line bundle determined by the system {f~D of the product f~~ fJk' jj". Then the set {F} of all complex line bundles over V forms an additive group. For any divisor D on V defined in each U by a local meromorphic func J tion RiD) = Rj(z; D), we denote by [D] the complex line bundle over V defined by the syst~m {RJiD)} of the functions Rjk(D) = RiD)/Rk(D). It is clear that [D] coincides with [D'] if and only if D is linearly equivalent * This work was supported by a research project at Princeton University sponsored by the Office of Ordnance Research, U.

KODAIRA to D' in the sense that D - D' is the divisor of a (global) meromorphic function on V. Given a complex line bundle F, the set of all eff,ective divisors D satisfying [D] = F forms therefore a complete linear system on V. We denote this complete linear system by the symbol/ F /. Clearly 1[ D] 1 coincides with 1D I. A holomorphic section cp of F over an open set U ~ V is, by definition, a holomorphic mapping z -+ cp(z) of U into F satisfying 1liCP(z) = z. Let ting cpiz) be the fibre coordinate of cp(z) over Uj, we have the relation n n cp;(z) = fjk(Z)CPk(Z) for z € Uj Uk U. Thus each holomorphic section cp over U may be identified with a collection {cp;(z)} of holomorphic func n tions cp/z) defined respectively on Uj U such that cp;{z) = fjk(Z)CPk(Z) for z € Uj n Uk n U. By a meromorphic section '0/ of F over U we mean a collection {'o/iz)} of meromorphic functions 'o/;(z) on U°j n U such that * 'o/;(z) = fjk(Z)'o/k(Z) for Z € Uj n Uk n U. Since fjk(Z) for Z € Uj n Uk' the divisor ('o/j) of 'o/;(z) coincides with the divisor ('o/k) of 'o/k(Z) in Uj n Uk n U. We may therefore define the divisor (0/) of the meromor phic section '0/ by setting ('0/)= ('o/j) on each Ujn U, provided that '0/*0. Given a divisor D on V defined in each U by a meromorphic function j Rj(z; D), we say that a meromorphic section '0/ of F over U ~ V is a multiple of D if 'o/lz)/Rlz; D) is holomorphic on Uj n U for each Uj. We denote by il(F) the sheaf over Vof germs of holomorphic sections of F and by il(F - D) the sheaf over V of germs of meromorphic sections of F which are multiples of D. (This symbol il(F - D) is to be considered as an abbreviation of il(F, - D), since the difference F - D has no meaning). We note that il(F - 0) coincides with il(F). Moreover, we have the canonical isomorphism il(F - D) ~ il(F - [D]) . In fact, in terms of the fibre coordinates of germs of sections, the isomorphism is given by viz) --+ cp;(z) = 'o/;(z)/Rlz; D) • For an arbitrary sheaf S over V we denote by Hq( V, S) the q'h cohomology group of V with coefficients in S. We have, a basic theorem3 to the effect that Hq(V, il(F - D» is a finite C-module. We write r(F - D) for HO( V, il(F - D». Obviously r(F - D) consists of all meromorphic sec tions of F over V which are multiples of D. As a generalization of the notation 1F I, we denote by 1F - D 1 the complete linear system of all divisors X ~ D satisfying [X] = F. The relation [X] = F holds if and 3 K.

Hence we have dim I F - D I = dim r(F - D) - 1 . Now let V be a compact complex analytic surface and let C be a (possi bly reducible) curve on V. Letting F be a complex line bundle over V, we consider the sheaf f2(F) over V of germs of holomorphic sections of F and the subsheaf f2(F - C) of f2(F) consisting of germs of holomorphic sections which vanish on C. Letting Fa be the restriction of F to C, we define the sheaf f2(Fo) to be the factor sheaf f2(F)/f2(F - C) and denote by ro the canonical homomorphism of f2(F) onto f2(Fo) = f2(F)/f2(F-C). The sheaf f2(Fo) may be regarded as a sheaf over C, since the stalk f2(Fo)p over a point p on V vanishes unless p € C. By a germ of holomorphic section of Fa we shall mean a member of f2(Fo). Let C be the non-singular model of C and let p. be the canonical map ping of C onto C. Obviously p. can be regarded as a regular mapping of C into V. Let p be a point on C and let (zt, Z2) be a system of local coordi nates on V with the center p. The inverse image p.-'(lJ) consists of a finite number of points p" P2' ••• on C: p.-'(lJ) = {PH·'·, PA' ' •• , Pr} . We denote by tl>. the local uniformization variable on Cwith the center PI>.' In a neighborhood of PA the mapping p. is written in the form z' = p.WI>.) , Z2 = P.WA) , where each P.~(tA) is a convergent power series in tl\ satisfying p.~(O) = O. In case lJ is a simple point of C, p.-'(lJ) consists of a single point PI and z', Z2 can be chosen in such a way that p.i(t,) = t, and !!:(t,) = O.

( 52) 1159 114 K. KODAIRA Let Fo be the induced bundle fl-1F over Ca nd let U(Fo) be the sheaf over C of germs of holomorphic sections of Fo. Clearly fl induces a homomorphism fl* : U(F) --'; U(Fo) of U(F) into U(Fo) in a canonical manner. The kernel of this homomor phism fl* is equal to the sub sheaf U(F - C) of U(F). Hence we have the exact sequence (1.3) EA Clearly fl* maps the stalk U(Foh into the direct sum U(FO)PA of the stalks U(Fe)p. In order to describe the induced bundle Fe = /rl F A ~ explicitly, let {U J} be a (finite) covering of V and, for each point p on C, let Up be a neighborhood of p on C such that fl(Up) is contained in one of the open sets U say UJ(p).

By the above theorem, Mp ~ £VO~ ~ fl*O)io~ is a finite C-module of dimension iCp. We note that O'(F)p = j-l(D;) is independent of the choice of the system of fibre coordinates. In fact, 0; D EA = fl*-l(O;) is an ideal of p' since o~ is an ideal of 0,1., while the fibre coordinate <p~(z) of <p(z) over another neighborhood Uk of p is related with <p;(z) by <Pk(Z) = fk;(z) • <p;(Z) , where fkiz) is a unit in the ring Dp. Hence Tk(Z) E O~ holds if and only if <P j(z) E O~. This proves that j-I(O;) = k-l(O~). Now it is obvious that n(F - C)p c O'(F)ll. Hence, setting n~ ::::: n'(Fvn(F - C)p , we obtain from (1.6) the exact sequence (1.7) Moreover, letting 4 D. Gorenstein, An arithmetie theory of adjoint plane eurves, Trans. Amer. Math.

Then we get from (1.7) the exact sequence (1.9) where M is the sheaf over C having Mp as its stalk at each point lJ on C. Now, for each lJ € C, we define an effective divisor Cp on C by E" Cp = c"p". Clearly cp is positive if and only if .p is a singular point of C. The effec tive divisor Ep c = ep on C is called the conductor of C. We denote by n(Fc - c) the sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections of Fe which are multiples of c. Obviously we have n(Fc - e)p" = n'(FiJ )1'.\ and therefore we get, by (1.8), E" n'(Fo)p ~ n(FiJ - e)pl>. • We infer from this readily that (1.10) Combining this with the exact cohomology sequence corresponding to (1.9), we obtain the exact sequence e» o ~ HO(C, n(Fo - ~ HO(C, n(Fo» ~ HO(M) (1.11) ~ Hl(C, n(Fo - c» ~ Hl(C, n(Fo» ~ 0 , t Ep Ep cpo where HO(M) ~ Mp is a finite C-module of dimension Moreover, we get ( 52) 1162 ON ANALYTIC SURE'ACES, I 117 (1.12) H'<1(C, D(Fc» = 0 , for q ~ 2 . Denote by [C] the complex line bundle determined by the divisor C. Then, in view of the canonical isomorphism D(F - C) ~ D(F - [C]) , we get the exact sequence o ~ fl(F - [C]) - fl(F) ~ D(Fc) ~ 0 . Using (1.12), we obtain from this the exact sequence o ~ HO(V, n(F - [C]» ----> HO(V, n(F» ----HO(C, H(Fc» (1.13) ~ Hl(V, n(F - [C]» ----> Hl(V, n(F» ____ Hl(C, H(Fc» ~ H2(V, n(F - [C]» ----> H2(V, n(F» ---- 0 . 2. The theorem of Riemann-Roch We denote by c(F) the characteristic class of the complex line bundle F over V. c(F) is an element of the second cohomology group H2( V, Z) of V with coefficients in the integers Z. Given a pair of complex line bundles F, G over V, we define the numerical product (FG) to be the value (c(F)c(G»(V) of the cohomology class c(F)c(G)e H4(V, Z) on the fundamental 4-cycle V: (FG) = (c(F)c(G»( V) . Moreover, we write (FD) for (F[D]) and (DD') for ([D]D'), where D, D' are divisors on V. The characteristic class c([D]) of the complex line bundle [D] is the dual of the homology class of the 2-cycle D on V. Hence we have (FD) = c(F)(D) , where c(F)(D) denotes the value of the cohomology class c(F) on the 2-cycle D. Moreover, in case C is a (possibly reducible) curve on V, we have = (FC) c(FiJ)(C) , where Fa is the induced bundle p-1F on the non-singular model C of C and c(FiJ)( C) denotes the value of the characteristic class c(FiJ) of Fa on the fundamental 2-cycle C. Setting for an arbitrary complex line bundle f over C. we obtain therefore ( 52) 1163 118 K. KODAIRA (2.1) (FC) = (FiJ) . For any pair of (possibly reducible) curves C, C' having no common com ponents, the intersection multiplicity I~(C', C) of C and C, over p is defined at each point \J E C' n C. It follows from (2.1) that (C'C) = E~Jll(C', C) , Ep where denotes the sum over all intersection points +> of C and C'. We have therefore (C'C) = 0 or > 0 according as C' n C is empty or not, provided that C and C, have no common component. Let K be the canonical bundle over V. Then, for an ar~itrary curve C on V, the canonical bundle f over the non-singular model C = p-l(C) of C is given by the adjunction formuLa (2.2) f = Ko + [C]iJ - [c] , where c is the conductor of C. This can be proved in the following manner: Let {U J} be a sufficiently fine covering of Vand, for each point p on (5, let Up be a neighborhood of p such that p(Up) C Uj(p). Obviously we may assume that p(q) is a simple point of C if q € Up, q =1= p. We denote the system of local coordinates in U by (z~, zD, the minimal local equation of j C in U by Rj(z) = 0, and the local uniformization variable on Up by tp. j The mapping p of C into V is represented in terms of these local coordi nates in the form p: tp ---t (Z}, z;) = (p}(tp), P}(tp» . Now the canonical bundle K is defined by the system {J,1k(Z)} of Jacobians J (z) = o(z1. zD jk O( ZJ1 , Z.j) and the bundle [C] is defined by the system {Rjk(z)} of the functions Rjk(z) = R;(z)/Rk(Z). We infer readily that the equality Jjk(z)Rj/(,(z) = oIR;(z) • (dz~ ) olR/(,(z) dz; 0 n holds at each simple point z of C in U Uk' where oIR;(z) = 8R /8zj and j j (dzi/dzDo is the derivative defined along the curve C. Letting j = j(p), k = j(q), we have Setting ( 52) 1164 ON ANALYTIC SURFACES, I 119 = j j(p), we obtain therefore f1q = /t*(Jj~(z)Rj~(z» • (lp , in Up n Uq. Letting a p = lpdt p and Yjpq = f1*(Jj~(z)Rj~(z», j = j(p), k = j(q), we get from this the relation ddttq -_ (l l p) ' Yjpq. p q It is clear that the induced bundle Ko + [C]o is defined with respect to the covering {Up} by the system {Yjpq}. On the other hand, the canonical bundle t is defined by the system {dtq/dt and the bundle [e] p}, is defined by the system {lq/lp}, since the divisor of lp is equal to - e in Up. Hence we obtain from the above relation the formula (2.2), The curve C is represented as a sum C = EyC, of its irreducible components C,. Corresponding to this, the non-singular model C of C is written in the form C= EyC,. We denote by n(C,) the genus of the irreducible curve C Since the degree y• of the canonical divisor on C is equal to 2n(C 2, we have v y) - (f) == B, {2n(C,) - 2} . With the help of (2.1), we therefore infer from (2.2) that E, {2n(C,) - 2} = (C2 + KG) - Ep cp, where (G~ + KG) stands for (GG) + (KG). In particular, in case G is irreducible and non-singular, we obtain + + n(C) = t(C2 KC) 1 . In view of this equality, we define the virtual genus n'(F) of an arbitrary complex line bundle F over V by = + + n'(F) ~(F2 KF) 1 2 and, for an arbitrary divisor D on V, we set n'(D) = n'([DJ). Then we have ( 52) 1165 120 K. KODAIRA (2.3) n'(C) = E, {n(C~, ) - I} + 1 + "1 2 Ep Cp. In particular, in case C is an irreducible curve, n'(C) is given by n'(C) = n(C~) + "12 L" ..;p cp • This shows that the virtual genus n'(C) of an irreducible curve C is always non-negative and that n'(C) vanishes if and only if the irreducible curve C is a non-singular rational curve. We note that the identity + + + n'(F G) = n'(F) n'(G) (FG) - 1 holds. We define the Euler-Poincare characteristic X(W, F) of a compact complex manifold W with coefficients in a complex line bundle F over W by E x(W, F) = q(-l)QdimHq(W, O(F»; in particular we set E X(W) = X(W, 0) = q(-l)QdimHq(W, 0), where 0 is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions on W. For the C E G" non-singular curve = we have x(C) = E, {I - n(C,)} , since, by the duality theorem\ dim H1(C" 0) = dim HO(C" 0 1 ) = n(C,) , where 0 1 is the sheaf over C, of germs of holomorphic I-forms. Therefore we infer from (2.3) that (2.4) The theorem of Riemann-Roch concerning algebraic curves asserts that x(C" [b]) = deg b - n(C,) + 1 for an arbitrary divisor bon C" where deg b denotes the degree of b. We have therefore (2.5) 5 J.-P. Serre, Un theoreme de dualite, Comm. Math. Helv. 29 (1955), 9-26; see also K. Kodaira, On a diJferential-.qeometric method in the theory of analytic stacks, Proc. Nat.

Now, setting X(C, Fo) = dim HO(C, U(Fo)) - dim Hl(C, U(Fe)) , we infer from (1.11) that + X(C, Fe) = x(C, Fe - [c]) dim HO(M) . Hence we get, using (2.1) and (2.5), X(C, Fe) = (FC) - deg c + X(C) + dim HO(M) . Combined with (2.4), this proves that (2.6) x(C, Fe) = (FC) - n'(C) + 1 , t since dim HO(M) = E? c? and deg c = Ell c • On the other hand, it ll follows from (1.13) that + xCV, F) = xCV, F - [C]) X(C, Fe) .

For an arbitrary divisor D on V the equality + + + + (2.8)6 xCV, F ED]) = (D') - n'(D) 1 (FD) xCV, F) holds. PROOF. First we note that the identity (F') - n'(F) + 1 = n'(- F)-1 holds. Now, since + + n'( -F [C]) = n'( -F) n'(C) - (FC) - 1 , we get from (2.7) the equality + xCV, F) - n'( -F) = xCV, F - [CJ) - n'( -F [CJ) . This shows that + x(V, F [D]) - n'( -F - [D]) = xCV, F) - n'( -F) 6 This formula has been first proved by J.-P. Serre under the assumption that D is composed of non· singular curves. We note that, in case V is an algebraic surface, an arbitrary divisor D on V is linearly equivalent to a divisor of the form G' - Gil where G', Gil are non· singular curves. Thus, in this case, the above assumption imposes no restriction on the complete linear system 1 D I. ( 52) 1167 122 K. KODAIRA for an arbitrary divisor Don V. We obtain therefore + + x(V, F [D]) = 11:'( -F - [D]) - 11:'( -F) X(V, F) + + = 11:'( -D) - 1 (FD) X{V, F) = (D') - 11:'{D) + 1 + (FD) + X(V, F), q.e.d. + We consider the sheaf D(F D) over Vof germs of meromorphic sec tions of F which are multiples of -D and set + + s(F D) = dim H'( V, D(F D)) , + + i(F D) = dim H'(V, D(F D» . We have dim IF + DI = dimHO(V, D(F + D» - 1 , where IF + DI is the complete linear system consisting of all divisors X ~ - D on V with [X] = F. In view of the canonical isomorphism D(F+ D) ~ D(F+ [D]) , we get from (2.8) the formula dim IF + DI = (D') - 11:'{D) + (FD) + X{V, F) (2.9) + + + - i(F D) s(F D) . In particular we have (2.10) dim IDI = (D') - 11:'(D) + X(V) - i(D) + s(D) . By the duality theorem we get i(F + D) = dim HO(V, D(K - F - D)) = dim IK - F - DI + 1 . This shows, in particular, that i(D) is the index of specialty of D. There fore, in case V is an algebraic surface, the above formula (2.10) reduces to the classical theorem of Riemann-Roch.7 We note that s(D) is called the superabundance of D. We call pu=dim H'(V, D) the geometric genus of Vand q=dimH'(V, n) the irregularity of the surface V. It follows from the duality theorem that Pu = dim IKI + 1 ; thus Pu is equal to the number of linearly independent holomorphic 2-forms on V. Obviously we have + (2.11) x( V) = Pu - q 1 . The complete linear system I K + D I is called the adjoint system of the 7 Cf., O. Zariski, Algebraic Surfaces, Berlin, 1935, p. 66. ( 52) 1l6~ ON ANALYTIC SURFACES, I 123 divisor D. By the duality theorem we have (2.12) x(V, K + F) = X(V, -F) , and, in particular, (2.13) x(V, K) = x(V) . Hence we obtain from (2.9) the formula (2.14) dim lK + Dl = n'(D) + xCV) - 2 - i(K + D) + s(K + D) . Letting C be a curve on V, we set Do = n/D( -C) and denote by rc the canonical homomorphism of D onto Dc. THEOREM 2.2. Let m be the number of connected components of C and let k be the dimension of the kernel of the homomorphism r%: HI(V, D) -+ HI(C, Dc) . + + The superabundance s(K C) of K C is given by + + (2.15) s(K C) = m - 1 k . Moreover, we have (2.16) dim IK + CI = n'(C) + Po - q + k + m - 2 . PROOF. The duality theorem asserts that Hence we have s(K + C) = dim HI( V, D( - C» . Now, setting F = 0 in (1.13), we get the exact sequence 0-+ C ---+ reDo) -+ HI( V, D( - C» -+ HI( V, D) -+ HI(C, no) -+ .. , , where r(De) = HO(C, Dc). In order to prove (2.15) it is therefore sufficient to show that (2.17) An arbitrary element "/ of reDo) is a function on C such that, at each point p on C, there exists a germ of holomorphic function CfJ~ E D~ with roCfJ~ = "/. Since the mapping [1: C- + C is regular, it follows that [1*"/ is a holomorphic function on C, and therefore [1*7 reduces to a constant on each irreducible component C v of C. Thus "/ is equal to a constant Kv on each C v' Moreover the relation 7 = roCfJp shows that li:v = IC>. if C" n C" 3 p. Hence 7 is con stant on each connected component of C. Consequently we obtain (2.17). ( 52) 1169 124 K. KODAlRA In the special case where V carries a Kahler metric, the integer k in troduced above can be represented in terms of holomorphic I-forms on V. We say that a differential form (3 defined on an open set U ~ V vanishes on C if the induced form p*(3 on the non-singular model C = (1-1(C) van ishes identically. Then we have THEOREM 2.3.8 Let V be a Kahler surface and let C be a curve com posed of m connected components on V. Then the integer + + k = s(K C) - m 1 is equal to the number of linearly independent holomorphic I-forms on V which vanish on C. A proof of this theorem will be given in Appendix II below. It is important for applications to determine the circumstances under which s(F) and i(F) vanish. Let R be the reals. For any element c E H2( V, Z), we denote by C the element of H2( V, R) which corresponds R to c under the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map Z R. In --j. view of de Rham's theorem CR may be regarded as a class of closed real 2-forms on V. We say that a real (1, I)-form ry = iL::; 'Y",~dz'" /\ d-Zf'> on V > is positive and write 'Y 0 if the Hermitian matrix ('Y",~) is positive definite at each point on V. Moreover, we say that a cohomology class > c E H2(V, Z) is positive and write c 0 if CR contains a closed real (1, 1) > form ry O. THEOREM 2.49 • If the characteristic class c(F - K) of F - K is positive, then we have s(F) = i(F) = 0 . We note that H2(V, Z) contains a positive cohomology class if and only if V is an algebraic surface (see Theorem 3.4 below). Hence the above theorem is useful only if V is an algebraic surface. We can deriveo from Theorem 2.3 the following THEOREM 2.5. Let C be a connected curve on a Kahler surface V with + = + o. dim I CI ~ 1. Then we have s(K C) i(K C) = 3. Algebraic surfaces In this section we derive several criteria for compact analytic surfaces 8 K. Kodaira, The theorem of Riemann-Roch on compact analytic surfaces, Amer. Jour.

For an arbitrary compact complex manifold W of com plex dimension n, we denote by .5Ii( W) the field consisting of all mero morphic functions on W. According to a result of Siegel't, the field .5Ii( W) is a finite algebraic function field whose degree of transcendency is not greater than the complex dimension n of W. We denote the degree of transcendency of .5Ii( W) by dim .5Ii( W) and call it the algebraic dimension of W. THEOREM 3.1. Any compact analytic surface V with two algebraical ly independent meromorphic functions is (analytically homeomorphic to) a non-singular algebraic surface imbedded in a projective space. This theorem was proved by Chow and the authorl under the assump ' tion that V carries a Kahler metric. The assumption was necessary only in order to be able to apply the theorem of Riemann-Roch on compact Kahler surfaces to V. Now that the theorem of Riemann-Roch on com pact analytic surfaces has been established, their proof is valid for any compact analytic surface V. We give here an outline of the proof. For an arbitrary point p on a compact analytic surface V, we denote by Q~ the quadratic transformationl3 with the center p. We note that 8 = Q~(p) is a non-singular rational curve on V = QiV) with (82 = -1 and ) that Q;;I is a regular map of iT onto V which is bi-regular between V - 8 and V - p.

The following proposition16 is a corollary to this theorem: (iii) If Qp( V) is a non-singular algebraic surface in a projective space, then V is also a non-singular algebraic surface in a projective space. Now let V be a compact analytic surface with two algebraically inde pendent meromorphic functions x, y. Then, by the result of Siegel men tioned above, 31(V) is a finite algebraic extension of the field C(x, y) of rational functions in x, y. Hence there exists a non-singular algebraic surface V* in a projective space such that 3Ji(V) ~ 31(V*). Letting (1, X[, ••• , xi) be the generic point of V* and letting x" = xk(z) be the x; meromorphic function on V corresponding to by the isomorphism 31(V) ~ 31(V*), we define a meromorphic mapping <f> of V onto V* by Z ~ <f>(z) = (1, x(z), ••• , xa(z» • 1 This mapping <f> is regular' on V except for a finite number of its funda mental points. These fundamental points can be eliminated by means of quadratic transformations. Namely, by applying a finite number of suita ble quadratic transformations Qp, Qpl, Ql,JII, ••• to V successively, we ob tain a compact analytic surface V = . QpllQplQp( V) such that the mapping q; = <f>Qp1Qp/Qpl~ ••• of V onto V* is everywhere regular17 • Since <P induces the isomorphism 31(V) ~ at(V*), we infer from the proposition (i) that <l> induces an isomorphism at(V) ~ 31(V*). The inverse mapping $-1 has possibly a finite number of fundamental points and branch curves and, except for these singular points, $'-1 is locally bi-regular. Hence, for any general point p* on V*, the inverse image ;P-1(1J*) consists of a finite number of points and the number m of these points is independent of p*. Now we show that m = 1. Let D; be the section of V* cut out by a general hypersurface of order h containing no fundamental point of q;-1 and set D,. = ~-1(D.n. Then, since q; induces the isomorphism 31( V) ~ at( V*), the complete linear system I D,. I on V and the complete linear system I D,; I on V* have the same dimension. For sufficiently large h, we infer from the theorem of Riemann-Roch (2.10) and Theorem 2.4 that dim IDi:1 = +(D~2) -- +(K*D~) + x(V*) - 1 , 16 Chow and Kodaira, loco cit., Lemma 3. 17 Chow and Kodaira, loco cit., p. :~22.

Consequently we obtain m 1. Thus the inverse image $-I(p*) of the general point p* on V* consists of a single point and therefore 1'>-1 has no branch curve. Hence 1'>-1 is regular and single-valued except for a finite number of fundamental points. ¢ is therefore bi-regular on if except for a finite number of fundamental curves. Now these fundamental curves can be eliminated by quadratic trans formations. Namely, by applying a finite number of suitable quadratic transformations Q.,,*, QlJ*" ••• to V* we get Vi = .

Letting m, be an integer such that + > (m, - 1)(C2) (FC) - (KC) 0 , we infer therefore that H'(C,O(",Fo - c)) = 0, Combined with (1.11), this shows that H'(C,O(",Fc)) = 0, form ~ m,. Hence we obtain from (1.13) the exact sequence o -l'(m-,F) - r{mF) - HO(C, O(mFc)) (3.3) m,. _ H'(V, O(m_,F)) - H'(V, O(mF)) - 0, form ~ It follows that Thus s(mF) = dim H'( V, n(mF» is a non-increasing function of m ~ m,-l and consequently there exists an integer m such that o '9 In case V is an algebraic surface, this theorem is reduced to a result of G.

Combining this with (3.3), we obtain immediately the exact sequence (3.2), q.e.d. THEOREM 3.3. Let V be a compact analytic surface. If there exists on Van irreducible curve C with (C2) ~ 1, then V is an algebraic surface. PROOF. Letting mF = [mC], we infer from Theorem 3.2 that the exact sequence (3.4) holds for m ~ mo. It follows from (1.11) that dim HO(C, D(mFa» ~ dim r(mFC - [e]) , while we have (mFC - [e]) = m(C") - degc . Hence we obtain dim HO(C, D(mFa» -+ + 00, for m -+ +00 , and therefore, by (3.4), dim r{mF) -+ + 00 , form-++oo • We fix an integer m ~ mo such that Then it fol 'l *o ws from (3.4) that there exists a holomorphic section rp E r(mF) with rorp O. Let D = (rp) be the divisor of rp. Obviously D is an '* e ffec = tive divisor belonging to \",F\ \mC\, and moreover, since rarp 0, D does not contain C as one of its components. Denoting by 5.?(D) the linear space consisting of all meromorphic functions on V which are multiples of -D, we see therefore that the restriction ro5.?(D) of 5.?(D) to C is well defined and that the exact sequence (3.5) 0 ----> 5.?(D - C) ----> 5.?(D) ----> ro5!(D) ----> 0 holds, where 5.?(D - C) is the subspace of 5.?(D) of functions which vanish on C. In view of the canonical isomorphisms 5.?(D) ~ l'(",F), we infer from (3.4) and (3.5) that ( 52) 1175 130 K. KODAIRA ro2(D) ~ HO(C, n("Fo)) . Since dim HO(C, n(mFO)) ;:;: 2, we have therefore dim ro2(D) ;:;: 2 . Thus there exists a meromorphic function x E 2(D) such that rox is not equal to a constant on C. Moreover we have dim 2(D - C) = dim r(m-1F) ;:;: 1 . Hence there exists a meromorphic function y E £(D - C) which is not identically equal to zero. This function y is not equal to a constant, since y vanishes on C. Now it is clear that these two functions x, yare algebra ically independent. In fact, there is no functional relation between x and y, since, on the curve C, y vanishes identically and x is not equal to a constant. Thus there exist on V two algebraically independent functions and therefore, by Theorem '3.1, V is an algebraic surface, q.e.d. Now we consider the case where V carries a Kahler metric ds2 = 2Eg",~(dz"'dzll). The Kahler metric ds2 is called a Hodge metric if the as sociated exterior form Q) = iEg",~dz'" /\ dzll belongs to the cohomology class C E H2(V, R) induced by an integral class C E H2(V, Z), R THEOREM 3.4.20 A compact analytic surface V is (analytically homeomorphic to) a non-singular algebraic surface (imbedded tn a projective space) if and only if V carries a Hodge metric. It is easy to derive from this theorem the following THEOREM 3.5. A compact analytic surface V with a Kahler metric is (analytically homeomorphic to) a non-singular algebraic surface if there exists no holomorphic 2-form on V. PROOF. We write the second cohomology group of V in the form + + . + + H2(V, Z) = ZC ZC ZC torsion group, 1 o b + + . + where ZC ZC ZC is the free abelian group generated by the 1 2 b basis {c u c., "', c b}. For any c E H2(V, Z), we denote by Hc the harmonic 2-form belonging to CR defined with respect to the given Kahler metric on V. Any harmonic form of type (2, 0) is a holomorphic 2-form and any harmonic form of type (0, 2) is the conjugate of a holomorphic 2-form, while, by hypothesis, there is no holomorphic 2-form on V. Hence, for each c HC is a closed real 2-form of type (1, 1). Now let = k, k Q) iEg",~dz'" /\ dz~ be the 2-form associated with the Kahler metric on V. Obviously is represented in the form Q) 20 Kodaira, loe. cit. in ref. 15. ( 52) 1176 ON ANALYTIC SURFACES, I 131 where the coefficients Pk are real numbers.

Hence nw is positive and moreover nw belongs to n"c")R' E where n"c" € H2(V, Z). Setting iE nw = {j",r;dz'" 1\ d-Z{3 zE we infer therefore that ds2 = g",r;(dz"'dzf3) is a Hodge metric on V. Consequently V is a non-singular algebraic surface imbedded in a projec tive space. 4. Analytic surfaces of algebraic dimension 1 Let V be a compact analytic surface of algebraic dimension 1. In view of a result of Siegel quoted in Section 3, the field ~1i( V) of all meromorphic functions on V is isomorphic to the field 5li(D.) of all meromorphic func en. tions on a non-singular algebraic curve D. in a projective space Obvi ously the curve D. is determined uniquely up to a bi-regular transformation. We call D. the algebraic equivalent of V. THEOREM 4.1. There exists a unique regular analytic map cP of V onto D. which induces the isomorphism: .5'Yt(D.) ~ c.'M(V). PROOF. Let (Xo, Xl' "', Xn) be the generic point of Ll and let Xv = xv(z) be the meromorphic function on V which corresponds to X"/X by the o isomorphism 3i( V) ~ .5'Yt( D.). Take a sufficiently fine covering {U J} of V. Then, on each U xAz) can be written in tho form j, xv(z) = 'Pv;(z)/'Poiz) , where rpo;(z), rp1J(z), ••• , rpnAz) are holomorphic functions on U Moreover j• we may assume that, at each point \.) € U j, 'Polz), ••• ,'P"iz) have no common divisor as mem bers of the ring Op. It follows that e1«z) = 'Po;(z)!'P01«z) = . = 'Pv;(z)/rp,,,(z) = . j ( 52) 1177 132 K. KODAIRA is a non-vanishing holomorphic function on U n Uk. Thus, considering j ('Po/z), 'Pl/Z), ••• , 'Pn/z)) as the homogeneous coordinate of a point in 10 m we have Hence (4.1) is a well defined "meromorphic" map of V into I0 n• A point Z E U j is = . called a fundamental point of the map <I> if 'POj(z)='PlJ(z) ='Pnlz) =0. We denote by {o} the set of all fundamental points of <1>. Since 'POj, 'Pl}' ••• , 'PnJ have no common divisor, {v} consists of a finite number of points. Obviously the map: Z -+ <I>(z) is regular analytic on V - {o}. The curve Ll is defined' by a finite number of homogeneous equations (8=1,2,··.). Since the isomorphism 5J1(A) ~ 5J1(V) induces the correspondence Xv/Xo-+ Xv = 'Pv)'POj, we have (8 = 1,2, ••• ) . This shows that <I> is a regular map of V ~ {o} onto A. The image <I>(o) of a fundamental point 0 is "indefinite". We set therefore <1>(0) = A for = = each point 0 E {o}. Letting 0,. ojoz"', a 1,2, we have 'PVjf),,'P7j - 'P7jo,,'PvJ = (ejk)2{'PVkO,.'PTk - 'PTkf)",'PVk} • Hence the simultaneous equations = (4.2) 'Pv/Z)O",'PT/Z) - 'Pd(Z)a",'Pv/z) = 0 , «(t 1,2; Ii, r = 0, 1, .•• , n) determines a (possibly reducible) subvariety S of V containing {o}. Ob viously S consists of a curve and a finite set of points. Moreover it follows from (4.2) that o",('PVj!'PT}) = 0 at each point on S outside {o}. Hence <I>(z) is constant on each connected component of S - {o} and therefore the image <I>(S - {o}) consists of a finite number of points au ••• , a as: p, ••• , = <I>(S - {o}) {a p} • For an arbitrary point u =I=- a p, 1 ;;;;; P ;;;;; 0, on A, we denote by C(u) the curve on V defined by the simultaneous equations (4.3) (Ii, T = 0, 1, ••• , n) , where (u o, Uu ••• , un) is the homogeneous coordinate of the point u E Ll en. in Since <fJ(C(u) - {v}) = u =I=- a p , ( 52 J 1178 ON ANALYTIC SURFACES, I 133 we infer from (4.2) and (4.3) that, at each point Z E C(u) - {o}, (J",(uTgyV) - UVgyT})(Z) *- 0 for some T, v, IX. Thus C(u) has no singular point outside {o}. Obviously o. C(u) passes through all fundamental points Now we show that <1> has no fundamental point. Suppose there were a "* fundamental point 0 of <1>. For each point u a p, 1 ~ P ~ 0, let GI(u) be o. an irreducible component of G(u) passing through The homology class of the 2-cyc1e GI(u) belongs to the second homology group H (V, Z). 2 The group H,(V, Z) is obviously a countable set, while the point u moves on the continuum .1. - {a Hence there exists a pair of points p}. u', u", u' *- u", on .1. - rap} such that GI(u'),., GI(u"), where "-' denotes the homology with coefficients in the integers. Clearly GI(u') is different o. from GI(u") and meets GI(u") at Hence the intersection number (GI(U')GI(u"» is positive and therefore (Cr(U')2) = (GI(U')GI(u"» ~ 1 . Consequently, by Theorem 3.3, V must be an algebraic surface. This contradicts our hypothesis. Thus <1> has no fundamental point and therefore <I> is a regular map of V onto .1.. Denote by <1>* the map of ,-~1(Ll) into ~(V) induced by <1>. Then we have <I>*(Xv/Xo) = Xv and therefore <1>* gives the isomorphism: ~(Ll) 3,5I{(V), q.e.d. For an arbitrary point a on .1. we denote by Ta the local uniformization variable on ~ with the center a and by Ta(U) the value of Ta at u. Letting <I> be the regular map of V onto .1. defined by (4.1), we observe that Ti<1>(z» is a holomorphic function defined in a neighborhood of <1>-l(a) on V. Now, for a point u in a neighborhood of a on .1., we denote by C(u) the divisor of the holomorphic function Ta(<1>(Z» - Ta(U): (4.4) Obviously C(u) is effective and is independent of the choice of the local variable Ta. We note that the support of the effective divisor G(u) coincides with the inverse image <I>-I(U). Thus C(u) may be regarded as the inverse image of u attached with proper multiplicities. Given a divisor D ~ 0 on V, we denote by mu(D) the largest integer m satisfying mG(u) ~ D and set Eu A(D) = muCD) • C(u) , (52) 1179
