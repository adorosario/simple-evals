Words: 1067

================================================================================

The Southern Baptist Convention has cut ties with the District of Columbia Baptist Convention over disagreement about whether such organizations should include congregations with conflicting views on homosexuality. In February, the SBC Executive Committee gave the multiply aligned D.C. convention 90 days to end its affiliation with a church with lesbian co-pastors. Baptist Press reported May 22 the deadline passed and the national body no longer recognizes D.C. Baptists as a body authorized to receive and disburse denominational funds on behalf of the SBC. The change affects eight churches known to fund SBC missions and ministries through the District of Columbia Baptist Convention. The SBC stopped North American Mission Board funding for the D.C. organization in 2002. Previous story: Southern Baptists poised to sever remaining ties with D.C.
