Therapy is the studio album by Anne-Marie. It was released on 23 July 2021, through Major Tom's and Asylum Records. The album serves as a follow up to her debut Speak Your Mind, and was preceded by four singles: "Don't Play", "Way Too Long", "Our Song", and "Kiss My (Uh Oh)". Background[] Planning for Anne-Marie's second album began in 2019; in an interview with Music Week in March of that year, she provided information on her upcoming second studio album, stating "I love the studio. I was able to get in there and have some sort of therapy with my own brain for a week and that's going towards the next album". She further commented that "the first album was made up of so many songs that people had heard for years and that's amazing. But for me as a creative person, I'm writing something new all the time and all I want to do is put it out straight away. That wasn't the way it happened with [the debut] album so, for this next one, I'm hoping to be more active on writing and put something out straight away that's fresh and no one's heard before." Through 2020, Anne-Marie released the standalone singles "Birthday", "Her", "To Be Young" featuring American rapper Doja Cat and "Problems". On 15 January 2021, Anne-Marie released the lead single of Therapy "Don't Play" in collaboration with English rapper KSI and English DJ, Digital Farm Animals. On 9 April 2021, the second single "Way Too Long" was released with Nathan Dawe and MoStack. On 21 May 2021, the third single "Our Song", a collaboration with Irish singer-songwriter Niall Horan, was released. On that date, Anne-Marie announced the title, cover art, and release date of Therapy. She later announced that she will embark on the Dysfunctional Tour in 2022, and Therapy: The Live Experience on 7 August 2021 in support of the album. On July 6, 2021, Anne-Marie launched a website via Twitter that enlisted the help of her fans/followers in determining the track-listing for the album, with new ones appearing on a daily basis. On July 7, 2021, random followers received DMs with one of two song snippets and parts of the title. On July 8, 2021, the track "Kiss My (Uh-Oh)" with British girlband Little Mix was revealed. Lumidee's "Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)" is sampled in the song. The song was announced as the album's fourth single on July 9, 2021 along with its release date being 23 July 2021.
