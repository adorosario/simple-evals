Sergio ChiamparinoFormer Mayor of Turin 26 December 2003: Sergio Chiamparino, a graduate in political science, was elected Mayor of the City of Turin on 27 May 2001. He began his political career as local party leader on a town council in the province of Turin of Italy’s left-wing PCI party. His political CV also includes positions as regional secretary of the trade union CGIL and member of parliament in Italy’s Chamber of Deputies. 29 May 2006: Mayor Chiamparino re-elected with more than 66 per cent of the vote The Mayor’s strategic vision for the City of Turin focuses on economic development and social cohesion. The planning directives for 2001 to 2006 set out how to implement this vision. In the coming years the development of Turin will proceed in the direction of converging the city’s traditional manufacturing and motor industry – Fiat is headquartered in Turin – with the technical-scientific business sector. The Mayor wishes Turin to become a centre for industrial innovation and be home to information and communication businesses. This development involves not only efforts to enforce the drive towards innovation but also the renewal of entire industrial areas. New telecommunications and logistical infrastructure needs to be created. The City must also attract and nurture entrepreneurial skills in innovative business sectors and raise education and training to international levels. The City of Turin will use the 2006 Winter Olympics to promote itself on the worldwide stage. The Games will force the City to complete major infrastructure and cultural projects by 2006 and thus act as a powerful motive to drive Turin’s development forward. The Mayor believes that the 2006 Winter Olympics, together with the City’s ability to complete projects associated with the Games on time and to the highest specifications, will enhance the international image of Turin and lead to further cultural and tourist initiatives. Turin’s integration within Europe will be strengthened with the completion of the high speed and capacity rail link between Lyon and Milan. Capacity at the City’s international airport will also be increased. While improved rail and air links will make the City more accessible from other European and international business centres, the city is also keen to upgrade its local transport systems. Mr Chiamparino also believes that for a city to ensure long-term success for its citizens and businesses it must be developed into a humane and safe community. Vulnerable groups of people and minorities must be part of civic society. Turin, under its Mayor, is developing many projects that aim to improve the quality of life of its people. The needs of families and the new poor are being addressed as a priority. Other projects deal with housing, education of children, the elderly, the integration of first and second generation non-EU immigrants and training-linked employment prospects. The Mayor has also introduced measures to combat crime to give people a greater sense of safety. Turin's Mayor sees the protection of the environment invariably linked to the promotion of public health and believes that only cities that offer the highest environmental quality will produce economic growth and attract investment.
