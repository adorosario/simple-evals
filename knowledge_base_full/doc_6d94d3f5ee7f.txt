The Model 430 programme was formally launched in February 1992 and two prototypes were built, these being modified from Model 230 airframes. The prototype of the Model 430 flew for the first time on 25 October 1994, the second following on 19 December that year, this having the full avionics suite designed for production aircraft. Production commenced in both Canada and the United States, Canadian certification being received in February 1996, and initial production deliveries commencing in 1995. Production of the Model 230 ceased in August 1995 in favour of the new model. The Model 430 featured a new four-blade bearingless, hingeless, composite main rotor and, compared to the Model 230, had a longer fuselage (46 cm / 18 in), more powerful Allison 250 turboshafts with FADEC and an optional EFIS flight deck. It also had as standard a Rogerson Kratos Integrated Instrument Display System which comprised two LCD displays, this providing engine information. The Model 430 was also available with a retractable undercarriage or skids. Between 17 August and 3 September 1996 an American from Texas, Ron Bower, with John Williams, in a Model 430 (N43011) broke the Round the World Helicopter Speed Record flying westwards from the United Kingdom. Examples have been supplied around the world, including one to the Bulgarian Air Force for VIP duties, attached to Aviootryad 28. First of the type seen in this region was VH-HIA (c/n 49027) imported for Aviation Tourism Australia operating from Hamilton Island, QLD. Further examples have been imported, including VH-VGG (c/n 49063) for Devereaux Holdings of Perth, WA.
