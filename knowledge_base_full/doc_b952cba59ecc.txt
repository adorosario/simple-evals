Two cavities carved on its back indicate that it was probably used as a ritual container, perhaps a cuauhxicalli, a vessel for human hearts extracted in ritual sacrifices.Felines are often represented at Teotihuacan in mural paintings, pottery and other media. Jaguars, in particular, were greatly revered by the people of Teotihuacan and other Mesoamerican cultures (for example, Olmec, Maya and Aztec) and were associated with rulership.Mural paintings depicting felines have been found, mainly in apartment compounds but also in some of the buildings bordering the Street of the Dead. One such building, now called the Palace of the Jaguars and located near the Pyramid of the Moon, depicts a procession of jaguars blowing large conch shell trumpets. In many instances, felines are shown in human pose, clothing and even with human body parts. It is possible that these anthropomorphic jaguars are impersonators dressed as felines for certain ceremonies.DetailsTitle: Calcite onyx ritual container in the form of a felineDate Created: 400/1600Physical Dimensions: Height: 16.00cmExternal Link: British Museum collection onlineSubject: mammalRegistration number: Am1926,-.22Place: Excavated/Findspot MexicoPeriod/culture: TeotihuacanOther information: Cultural rights may apply.Material: onyxCopyright: Photo: © Trustees of the British MuseumAcquisition: Purchased from Wake, L H.
