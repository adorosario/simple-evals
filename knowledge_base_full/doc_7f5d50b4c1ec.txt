Please reload the page. tomas5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Album Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2024Verified Purchase I ordered this CD expecting the Rare (Deluxe) album that is seen on streaming platforms. That is not what came. If you are expecting the songs "Boyfriend", "Souvenir", "She", and "Feel Me", they are not included on this deluxe version. However, this version comes with the songs "Bad Liar", "Fetish", "It Ain't Me", "Back To You", and "Wolves." For me, this makes up for the missing songs because they are all excellent songs from her droplet era that I now have in one place.Overall, this is an amazing album front to back and is an underrated pop masterpiece from Selena Gomez.

Há muito mais destaque para a imagem da Selena , e possui a vibe instrospectiva que a capa busca trazer.Não possui as faixas deluxe do rare, infelizmente porque são muito boas. "She", "Boyfriend" e a maravilhosa "Souvenir".Porém possui os singles lançados entre o Revival e o Rare, incluindo as incríveis Fetish e Bad Liar. São as 13 faixas do álbum + 5 faixas adicionais.É uma ótima edição pros fãs e um bom produto para quem gosta de música pop.

That is not what came. If you are expecting the songs "Boyfriend", "Souvenir", "She", and "Feel Me", they are not included on this deluxe version. However, this version comes with the songs "Bad Liar", "Fetish", "It Ain't Me", "Back To You", and "Wolves." For me, this makes up for the missing songs because they are all excellent songs from her droplet era that I now have in one place.Overall, this is an amazing album front to back and is an underrated pop masterpiece from Selena Gomez.

Há muito mais destaque para a imagem da Selena , e possui a vibe instrospectiva que a capa busca trazer.Não possui as faixas deluxe do rare, infelizmente porque são muito boas. "She", "Boyfriend" e a maravilhosa "Souvenir".Porém possui os singles lançados entre o Revival e o Rare, incluindo as incríveis Fetish e Bad Liar.

That is not what came. If you are expecting the songs "Boyfriend", "Souvenir", "She", and "Feel Me", they are not included on this deluxe version. However, this version comes with the songs "Bad Liar", "Fetish", "It Ain't Me", "Back To You", and "Wolves." For me, this makes up for the missing songs because they are all excellent songs from her droplet era that I now have in one place.Overall, this is an amazing album front to back and is an underrated pop masterpiece from Selena Gomez.

That is not what came. If you are expecting the songs "Boyfriend", "Souvenir", "She", and "Feel Me", they are not included on this deluxe version. However, this version comes with the songs "Bad Liar", "Fetish", "It Ain't Me", "Back To You", and "Wolves." For me, this makes up for the missing songs because they are all excellent songs from her droplet era that I now have in one place.Overall, this is an amazing album front to back and is an underrated pop masterpiece from Selena Gomez.

That is not what came. If you are expecting the songs "Boyfriend", "Souvenir", "She", and "Feel Me", they are not included on this deluxe version. However, this version comes with the songs "Bad Liar", "Fetish", "It Ain't Me", "Back To You", and "Wolves." For me, this makes up for the missing songs because they are all excellent songs from her droplet era that I now have in one place.Overall, this is an amazing album front to back and is an underrated pop masterpiece from Selena Gomez.

Há muito mais destaque para a imagem da Selena , e possui a vibe instrospectiva que a capa busca trazer.Não possui as faixas deluxe do rare, infelizmente porque são muito boas. "She", "Boyfriend" e a maravilhosa "Souvenir".Porém possui os singles lançados entre o Revival e o Rare, incluindo as incríveis Fetish e Bad Liar. São as 13 faixas do álbum + 5 faixas adicionais.É uma ótima edição pros fãs e um bom produto para quem gosta de música pop.
