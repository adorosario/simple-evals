Read more about this sculpture in the article below!Contents Toggle Artist Abstract: Who Was Michelangelo?Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni was born on March 6, 1475, in the village of Caprese in Arezzo, Florence. He died on 18 February 1564 in Rome. He was multitalented and excelled as a sculptor, painter, poet, and architect, also known as a polymath. He was one of the most well-known artists of his time with several biographies and commissions from Catholic Popes and wealthy families. He was also nicknamed as the “Divine One” because of his masterful and almost magical skill of artmaking, notably sculptures. Some of his famous artworks include the Pietà (1498 – 1499), David (1501 – 1504), and the majestic paintings of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican City in Rome, for example, The Creation of Adam (1508 – 1512) and The Last Judgment (1534 – 1541).Portrait of Michelangelo (c. 1545) by Daniele da Volterra; Attributed to Daniele da Volterra, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Madonna of Bruges (1503 – 1506) by Michelangelo in ContextArtistMichelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475 – 1564)Date Painted c. 1503 – 1506Medium MarbleGenreSculpturePeriod/Movement High RenaissanceDimensions (Meters)Height: About twoSeries/Versions N/AWhere Is It Housed?Church of Our Lady, Bruges, BelgiumWhat It Is Worth It was reportedly bought by Giovanni and Alessandro Moscheroni in 1504 for 100 ducats (4,000 Florins). In the contextual analysis, you will read more about when the Madonna and Child sculpture by the famous Renaissance virtuoso, Michelangelo, was sculpted and some of its interesting adventures before it found its way to the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium. A formal analysis will discuss the sculpture in terms of the subject matter and primary art elements. Contextual Analysis: A Brief Socio-Historical OverviewThe Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo was believed to have been completed between 1503 to 1506. There has also been minimal information about the sculpture’s commission, but it is believed that Michelangelo’s patrons were the Flemish Mouscron brothers, Jean and Alexander, who paid the artist 100 ducats. The Mouscron brothers were wealthy cloth merchants. Michelangelo reportedly started the sculpture in Carrara in Italy and after its completion, he was believed to have shipped it to Bruges in Belgium in 1506. Its purpose was believed to be for an altarpiece for the chapel that belonged to the Mouscron family in the Church of Our Lady.There has been extensive scholarly debate around the purpose of the Bruges Madonna and Child, and according to some sources it was reportedly created to be in an enclosed recess that would be above the altar.There are also reportedly carvings from Michelangelo’s chisel behind the Madonna and Child sculpture, which further emphasizes that it was possibly designed for a recessed space, or “niche”, which is how it is displayed in the church. This also points to the way Michelangelo depicted the Mother Mary and Jesus Christ. As some scholarly sources suggest, the child figure of Jesus is seemingly ready to walk down from standing between Mother Mary’s legs to the altar, which evokes the sacrificial symbolism associated with Jesus Christ and Mother Mary. Formal Analysis: A Brief Compositional OverviewThe formal analysis will describe Michelangelo’s Madonna sculpture titled, Madonna of Bruges, which is housed at the Church of Our Lady in the city of Bruges, Belgium. It will also discuss how the main art elements occur throughout the art piece that creates it.Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Subject Matter: Visual DescriptionThe Bruges Madonna and Child reportedly stands at two meters in height and is sculpted from a Carrara marble block. It depicts the Virgin Mary sitting while gazing downwards with an expression that appears similarly downcast. Her left foot (our right) is propped up higher than her right foot (our left), and her right hand rests loosely on her lap.Nestled on the inside of Mother Mary’s propped-up left leg is the child figure of Jesus Christ, who is not lying down or sitting, but standing. Mother Mary’s left hand is partly around Jesus Christ’s left side, and He is holding onto his mother’s left hand with his right hand, depicting his right arm reaching loosely in front of him. Jesus appears as if he is about to move out of his position and both appear somewhat emotionally detached from one another.The Child in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Color and ValueWhile Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child is a marble sculpture, the only color that occurs here is the white of the marble itself.

The form is also naturalistic as it resembles a real-life depiction of figures. Additionally, Michelangelo also constructed the form of the sculpture in the pyramidal style.While shapes appear two-dimensional, the type of shapes evident here is the circular shape on top of the rectangular shape that adorns Mother Mary’s dress around her upper chest area.

He was one of the most well-known artists of his time with several biographies and commissions from Catholic Popes and wealthy families. He was also nicknamed as the “Divine One” because of his masterful and almost magical skill of artmaking, notably sculptures. Some of his famous artworks include the Pietà (1498 – 1499), David (1501 – 1504), and the majestic paintings of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican City in Rome, for example, The Creation of Adam (1508 – 1512) and The Last Judgment (1534 – 1541).Portrait of Michelangelo (c. 1545) by Daniele da Volterra; Attributed to Daniele da Volterra, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Madonna of Bruges (1503 – 1506) by Michelangelo in ContextArtistMichelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (1475 – 1564)Date Painted c. 1503 – 1506Medium MarbleGenreSculpturePeriod/Movement High RenaissanceDimensions (Meters)Height: About twoSeries/Versions N/AWhere Is It Housed?Church of Our Lady, Bruges, BelgiumWhat It Is Worth It was reportedly bought by Giovanni and Alessandro Moscheroni in 1504 for 100 ducats (4,000 Florins). In the contextual analysis, you will read more about when the Madonna and Child sculpture by the famous Renaissance virtuoso, Michelangelo, was sculpted and some of its interesting adventures before it found its way to the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium. A formal analysis will discuss the sculpture in terms of the subject matter and primary art elements. Contextual Analysis: A Brief Socio-Historical OverviewThe Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo was believed to have been completed between 1503 to 1506. There has also been minimal information about the sculpture’s commission, but it is believed that Michelangelo’s patrons were the Flemish Mouscron brothers, Jean and Alexander, who paid the artist 100 ducats. The Mouscron brothers were wealthy cloth merchants. Michelangelo reportedly started the sculpture in Carrara in Italy and after its completion, he was believed to have shipped it to Bruges in Belgium in 1506. Its purpose was believed to be for an altarpiece for the chapel that belonged to the Mouscron family in the Church of Our Lady.There has been extensive scholarly debate around the purpose of the Bruges Madonna and Child, and according to some sources it was reportedly created to be in an enclosed recess that would be above the altar.There are also reportedly carvings from Michelangelo’s chisel behind the Madonna and Child sculpture, which further emphasizes that it was possibly designed for a recessed space, or “niche”, which is how it is displayed in the church. This also points to the way Michelangelo depicted the Mother Mary and Jesus Christ. As some scholarly sources suggest, the child figure of Jesus is seemingly ready to walk down from standing between Mother Mary’s legs to the altar, which evokes the sacrificial symbolism associated with Jesus Christ and Mother Mary. Formal Analysis: A Brief Compositional OverviewThe formal analysis will describe Michelangelo’s Madonna sculpture titled, Madonna of Bruges, which is housed at the Church of Our Lady in the city of Bruges, Belgium. It will also discuss how the main art elements occur throughout the art piece that creates it.Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Subject Matter: Visual DescriptionThe Bruges Madonna and Child reportedly stands at two meters in height and is sculpted from a Carrara marble block. It depicts the Virgin Mary sitting while gazing downwards with an expression that appears similarly downcast. Her left foot (our right) is propped up higher than her right foot (our left), and her right hand rests loosely on her lap.Nestled on the inside of Mother Mary’s propped-up left leg is the child figure of Jesus Christ, who is not lying down or sitting, but standing. Mother Mary’s left hand is partly around Jesus Christ’s left side, and He is holding onto his mother’s left hand with his right hand, depicting his right arm reaching loosely in front of him. Jesus appears as if he is about to move out of his position and both appear somewhat emotionally detached from one another.The Child in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Color and ValueWhile Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child is a marble sculpture, the only color that occurs here is the white of the marble itself.

There are also reportedly carvings from Michelangelo’s chisel behind the Madonna and Child sculpture, which further emphasizes that it was possibly designed for a recessed space, or “niche”, which is how it is displayed in the church. This also points to the way Michelangelo depicted the Mother Mary and Jesus Christ. As some scholarly sources suggest, the child figure of Jesus is seemingly ready to walk down from standing between Mother Mary’s legs to the altar, which evokes the sacrificial symbolism associated with Jesus Christ and Mother Mary. Formal Analysis: A Brief Compositional Overview The formal analysis will describe Michelangelo’s Madonna sculpture titled, Madonna of Bruges, which is housed at the Church of Our Lady in the city of Bruges, Belgium. It will also discuss how the main art elements occur throughout the art piece that creates it. Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Subject Matter: Visual Description The Bruges Madonna and Child reportedly stands at two meters in height and is sculpted from a Carrara marble block. It depicts the Virgin Mary sitting while gazing downwards with an expression that appears similarly downcast. Her left foot (our right) is propped up higher than her right foot (our left), and her right hand rests loosely on her lap. Nestled on the inside of Mother Mary’s propped-up left leg is the child figure of Jesus Christ, who is not lying down or sitting, but standing. Mother Mary’s left hand is partly around Jesus Christ’s left side, and He is holding onto his mother’s left hand with his right hand, depicting his right arm reaching loosely in front of him. Jesus appears as if he is about to move out of his position and both appear somewhat emotionally detached from one another. The Child in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Color and Value While Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child is a marble sculpture, the only color that occurs here is the white of the marble itself. It does not have any other colors painted onto it. The value of the art piece can also fluctuate due to changes in the lighting around the piece inside the church. This could create darker, more shaded, areas or lighter areas where the light will find it. Color and Value in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons The physical texture of the Madonna and Child sculpture appears smoothly carved, but Michelangelo was skillful in implying textures. For example, Mother Mary’s drapery appears soft and flowy in its folds as it hangs down to her feet. Additionally, both figures’ skin and hair appear smooth and soft, notice the chubby texture of Jesus Christ’s revealed belly. Belly Texture in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons The type of lines that occur in the Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo are free-flowing and naturalistic, ranging from curved to diagonal lines that all create the figures’ contours. Notice the diagonal lines created by the folds of Mother Mary’s drapery. This gives the sculptural composition a dynamism as if there is a sense of movement. Drapery Line in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons Shape and Form Michelangelo’s Madonna and Child sculpture is a three-dimensional form because it can be viewed from multiple angles. The form is also naturalistic as it resembles a real-life depiction of figures. Additionally, Michelangelo also constructed the form of the sculpture in the pyramidal style. While shapes appear two-dimensional, the type of shapes evident here is the circular shape on top of the rectangular shape that adorns Mother Mary’s dress around her upper chest area. Shape in Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Lev Pavliuk, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons The Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo occupies a three-dimensional space because it has a width, height, and depth as compared to a canvas, which is two-dimensional with width and height. However, because it is in an enclosed recess in the wall, it can only be viewed from the front. Madonna of Bruges (1501-1506) by Michelangelo; Michelangelo, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons Michelangelo Turning Heads Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo was reportedly shipped to Paris in 1794 during the French Revolution, after which it was returned to its home in Bruges, only to be uprooted again in 1944, during World War II, when it was stolen by the German Nazi’s and stored in a salt mine. It was eventually returned to Bruges, and its tale became part of the movie titled The Monuments Men (2014), which was about the recovery of stolen artworks by the Nazis during World War II. The Madonna of Bruges during recovery from the Altaussee salt mine (1945); See page for author, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons The Madonna of Bruges by Michelangelo has not received the same admiration as that of the artist’s other sculptures, such as the beloved Pietà (1498 – 1499), of which the two sculptures shared similar stylistic elements. It has nonetheless had a tale of its own, and Michelangelo’s depiction of one of the most popular Renaissance imageries, the Madonna and Child, certainly turned heads and raised questions about its meaning.
