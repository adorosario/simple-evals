Welcome To The National Portrait Gallery, Sylvia Rivera!Rachel Shuttleworth2 min read·Nov 4, 2015--ListenSharePress enter or click to view image in full sizeSmart Girls in the art world alert! This week, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., announced the first portrait of a transgender American to be included in its already historic collection: A photograph of Sylvia Rivera, one of the foremost activists in the national fight against gender discrimination. Rivera’s portrait was installed in the National Portrait Gallery’s “Struggle for Justice” exhibition at the beginning of October as part of the gallery’s paper rotation.Rivera sits in the center of the photograph, between her partner Julia Murray (right) and Christina Hayworth.As described by the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which was founded in her name and works to provide legal services for those who cannot afford representation — particularly transgender, intersex, and gender nonconforming people — Sylvia was a tireless advocate for all those who had been marginalized as the “gay rights” movement became more mainstream. She was a veteran of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, fought hard against the exclusion of transgender people from the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act in New York, and for years was a loud and persistent voice for the rights of people of color and low-income queer and trans people.We think Sylvia Rivera and her life’s work are simply incredible, and her portrait being hung in such an esteemed collection is a well-deserved honor. Who are some people you would like to see honored in a manner like this? Are there any LGBT activists, past or present, who inspire you?
