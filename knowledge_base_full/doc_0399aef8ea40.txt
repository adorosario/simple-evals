Earthquake Disaster Risk Reduction through awareness raising and educa Project ID 221GHA2000 Ghana's seismological history informs that the country has had earthquakes of which the last three major ones occurred in 1862, 1906 and 1939. The recent four minor earthquakes were felt in Ghana within a relatively short space of time on March 24, 2018, December 9, 2018, January 13, 2019 and March 2, 2019 and had estimated magnitudes of 3.3, 3.3, 2.6 and 3.9 on the Richter scale respectively. After undertaking consultations with some Agencies and Ministries, UNESCO and the WFP will produce educational materials on earthquake disaster risk reduction. Also, a 5-minute animation story with content based on the documented information on the 1939 earthquake will be developed.
