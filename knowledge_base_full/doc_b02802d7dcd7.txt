Adopting conversation analysis as an analytical framework, it aims to extend our understanding of the use of learner-initiated translanguaging and teacher responsiveness to translanguaging as an important interactional resource for learners to achieve interactional goals. The study identifies eight facilitative uses of L1. On the one hand, these uses contribute to the progressivity of talk as self-addressed translanguaging. On the other, they support intersubjectivity as co-constructed translanguaging in L2 interaction. These uses include (1) connectives for topic management; (2) floor-holding devices; (3) explicit word searches; (4) lexical gap fillers; (5) understanding displays; (6) clarification requests; (7) confirmation checks; and (8) explicit request for assistance. The study also reveals that learners’ self-initiated repair using L1 was frequently observed and that its use was intertwined with translanguaging in its functionality in discourse for meaning-making as a discursive practice. This study suggests that the use of translanguaging in the L2 classroom can be an indispensable tool to optimise learners’ classroom interactional competence.Keywords: translanguaging, conversation analysis, interactional repertoire, repair, classroom interactional competence, scaffoldingArticle outline1.Introduction2.Approaching interactional discourse as social action: Analytical framework2.1L2 classroom interactional competence2.2Translanguaging and self-repair in L2 classroom interaction2.3Interaction mediated through the use of L1 in L2 learning3.The study and method3.1Participants and research context3.2Data collection3.3Data analysis4.Findings4.1Self-addressed translanguaging within a turn4.1.1Connectives for topic management4.1.2Interaction maintenance – floor maintenance device4.1.3Explicit word search4.1.4Lexical gap fillers4.2Co-constructed translanguaging across turns4.2.1Understanding displays4.2.2Clarification requests and confirmation checks4.2.2.1Request for clarification of the question asked4.2.2.2Confirmation check facilitated through interpretation of L2 utterance4.2.3Initiating request for assistance5.Discussion and conclusionAcknowledgementsAbbreviationsReferences Published online: 3 January 2023DOI logo with linkhttps://doi.org/10.1075/ap.20014.harCopy icon with linkLinkedIn logo with linkBluesky logo with linkFacebook logo with linkReferences (89) References Al Masaeed, K.
