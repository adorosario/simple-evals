He composed over 2,000 songs including the world-renowned "Katyusha" in 1938. He was active until 1975.[1] Early life[] He was the son of Jewish craftsman born in the town of Pochep, Chernigov Governorate, Russian Empire. He studied piano and violin at the Kursk Higher Music School, then continued to pursue his studies in violin and music composition in Moscow between 1917 and 1919. Career[] Shortly after completing his studies, he composed his first songs in the 1920s, although they were just light dance and jazz music. One of those composition was the 1923 "John Gray", a foxtrot that became quite popular. In the 1930s, when Soviet ideology grew more intense, Blanter shifted gears and wrote Soviet propaganda songs and mass songs instead. These included "The Song of Shchors" (1935), "Partisan Zheleznyak" (1936), "Youth" (1937), "Stalin Is Our Battle-Glory" (1937), "The Football March" (1938), and of course, "Katyusha". "Katyusha" was written by Mikhail Isakovsky, with whom Blanter collaborated for the creation of this masterpiece, which is about an amalgamation of upbeat heroic battle music and sad peasant music representing a woman's lamentation for an absent lover. "Katyusha" grew popular during World War II as an inspiration for one to defend their land from foes. It has been translated into countless languages and the song remains popular throughout every generation in the world today. Blanter helped the Red Army in the Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation in 1945. He was commissioned by Stalin to compose a song about it. During a German delegation led by Wehrmacht general Hans Krebs (this was after Hitler's suicide), Blanter was pushed into a closet by Soviet Marshal Vasily Chuykov, and fell unconscious due to a lack of oxygen. He collapsed out of the closet, putting Chuykov in a bad light and shocked the German delegates.[2][3][4] Blanter wrote several other popular wartime songs, such as "The Enemy Burned Down His Home" (1945) which is about a soldier who returns from the front to find his entire family dead. Authorities disallowed the song to be performed because they thought it was too dark, so it didn't get to be performed until 1961. Other postwar songs of his include "The Migratory Birds Are Flying" (1949), and "Dark-Eyed Cossack Girl".[5] In 1983, he became a member of the AZCSP. He died in Moscow in 1990 at age 87.
