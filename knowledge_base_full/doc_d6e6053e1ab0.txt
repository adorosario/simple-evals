Biographical/historical information Conductor, radio host, and music educator David Randolph (1914-2010) was an active member of the New York classical music community, and served as musical director of the Randolph Singers, the Masterwork Chorus, and The St. Cecilia Chorus. David Rosenberg was born in Manhattan in 1914 to Morris Rosenberg (born ca.1892) and Elsie Goodman (1893-1979). He changed his surname to Randolph shortly after graduating from high school. Randolph graduated from City College of New York with a bachelors degree in music in 1936, and in 1942 received a masters of arts degree from the Teacher’s College at Columbia University. From 1943 to 1947, Randolph worked as a music specialist for the United States Office of War Information. During this time he also formed a professional chamber ensemble called the Randolph Singers that recorded and performed around New York and elsewhere until 1972. He began his 33 year radio career at WNYC as the host of “Music for the Connoisseur,” later called “The David Randolph Concerts,” and in 1947 wrote radio scripts for classical music programs on the Columbia Broadcasting System. In 1948, Randolph married Mildred Greenberg (1913-2008), a member of the Randolph Singers and the executive coordinator for The St. Cecilia Chorus.

Over his career he conducted 173 complete performances of George Frideric Handel’s Messiah. Both ensembles performed frequently at Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, and other prominent New York area venues. In addition to performing, Randolph was a devoted music educator. He taught at Montclair State University, Fordham University, and The New School, among others, and lectured in academic institutions and concert halls around the country. Randolph was also involved with The Masterwork School, St. Cecilia Chorus Educational Outreach Program, and choral seminars at Mohonk Mountain House. In 1964 he published a music appreciation book entitled This Is Music: A Guide to the Pleasures of Listening. Randolph received honorary doctorates from the College of Staten Island, and Saint Peter’s College, New Jersey, and the City College of New York awarded him the Townsend Harris Medal for outstanding achievements and distinguished service to the city. Randolph died in Manhattan on May 12, 2010.

Also present are communications concerning performances, lectures, and publishing, including letters from Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, The St. Cecilia Chorus, the Masterwork Chorus, the Griffith Music Foundation, MidAmerican Productions, Mohonk Mountain House, and various institutions of higher education.
