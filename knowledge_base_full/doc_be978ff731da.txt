================================================================================

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Gibson-Fawcett Award) Prize awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry The Gibson–Fawcett Award is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry[1] every two years to recognise outstanding work in the field of materials chemistry.[2] In particular, the emphasis is on the originality and independence of the work carried out.[3] The prize was established in 2008 and is awarded by the Materials Chemistry Division Awards Committee. It can only be given to researchers under age 40.[4] The award was discontinued in 2020.[5] History[edit] The award is named after Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett,[6] eminent chemists who worked together with Anton Michels on the study of the role of high pressure in chemical reactions. This led to the discovery of polyethylene.[6] Winners[edit] Year Winner Institution Reason 2010 Simon Clarke University of Oxford Chemistry of non-oxide and mixed anion solids as new functional materials[7] 2012 Andrew Fogg University of Liverpool Time resolved X-ray diffraction to study the synthesis of new materials[4] 2014 Andrew Dove University of Warwick New biodegradable materials for drug delivery and regenerative surgery[8][9] 2016 Rachel O'Reilly University of Warwick Polymer synthesis, nanostructures and enzyme mimetic constructs[10] 2018 Silvia Vignolini University of Cambridge Bio-materials and bio-mimetic photonic nanostructures[2] 2020 Cinzia Casiraghi University of Manchester For the development of practical biocompatible inks made of 2D materials and their applications in the biomedical field and in printed electronics[11] See also[edit] List of chemistry awards References[edit] ^ Atterberry, Tara (2009).
