Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for revolutionising the genre of landscape painting with his pictures of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home – now known as "Constable Country" – which he invested with an intensity of affection. "I should paint my own places best", he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, "painting is but another word for feeling".Constable's most famous paintings include Wivenhoe Park, Dedham Vale and The Hay Wain. Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, he was never financially successful. He became a member of the establishment after he was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school.Show lessRead moreWikipediaOnline ExhibitArtist highlightsSlideshow auto-selected from multiple collections2 storiesStoryExplore John Constable's painting, 'Rainstorm over the Sea'Royal Academy of ArtsStoryExplore John Constable's painting, 'The Leaping Horse'Royal Academy of ArtsDiscover this artist369 itemsOrganize byRelated works from the webArtworks not sourced from our partners' collectionsThe Hay Wain (1821)www.wikidata.orgThe Hay Wain - WikidataFlatford Mill (‘Scene on a Navigable River’)www.wikidata.orgFlatford Mill - WikidataDedham Lock and Mill (1820)www.wikidata.orgDedham Lock and Mill - WikidataSalisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds (1823)www.wikidata.orgSalisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds - WikidataMalvern Hall (1821)en.wikipedia.orgMalvern Hall (painting) - WikipediaRainstorm over the Sea (1828)www.wikidata.orgRainstorm over the Sea - WikidataStour Valley and Dedham Church (1815)www.wikidata.orgStour Valley and Dedham Church - WikidataOld Hall, East Bergholt (1801)en.wikipedia.orgOld Hall, East Bergholt - WikipediaA Cottage in a Cornfield (1817)www.wikiart.orgA Cottage in a Cornfield, 1817 - John Constable - WikiArt.orgDedham Vale (1802)reprodukcijos.ltJohn Constable's "Dedham Vale" 1802 – Masterpiece of English .“I never saw an ugly thing in my life: for let the form of an object be what it may - light, shade, and perspective will always make it beautiful.”John ConstableJun 11, 1776 - Mar 31, 1837More art movementsRomanticism7,119 itemsMore mediumsOil paint93,499 itemsEtching47,271 itemsGraphite111,283 itemsLaid paper18,592 itemsWatercolor painting70,609 itemsEngraving79,850 itemsInterested in Visual arts?Get updates with your personalized Culture WeeklyNo, thanksSign up nowYou are all set!Your first Culture Weekly will arrive this week.Ok John Constable RA was an English landscape painter in the Romantic tradition.
