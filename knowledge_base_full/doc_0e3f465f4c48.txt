An Intro & Analysis of the Music of the Trails/Kiseki FranchiseAnalyzing the themes & composers behind the Trails/Kiseki soundtracksBLACKDISC15 min read·Mar 3, 2022--ListenShareThe Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise (also known as ‘Kiseki’ in Japan) is a series of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) developed by Nihon Falcom. Each games’ soundtrack across the franchise hosts a diverse range of music and genres that fully represent the tone and narrative of their respective stories, themes and characters. This article aims to introduce those that may not know about this series as well as existing fans of the series to some of the standout tracks and the composers behind them as well as analyze the soundtracks from a thematic and narrative point of view. Falcom and its community do a great job of crediting its composers, artists and arrangers so if there’s a specific track you like it’s not difficult to find songs of similar structure.Note: This article is best experienced by listening to this youtube playlist while reading. Also, I have only played up to Trails of Cold Steel III as of writing this so that is as far as the article will cover for now. I’ve marked my personal favorite songs with an asterisk*Spoilers will kept to a minimum and will be marked otherwise. If you prefer to go into games 100% blind I suggest you skip the first paragraph in each section as they cover how the soundtracks reflect the tone, plot and themes of the games. Otherwise this article is completely spoiler free.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the SkyThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Sora No Kiseki) (2004)Also known as Trails in the Sky FC, this is the first chapter of the saga and the start of the Sky/Liberl arc. This soundtrack represents the humble beginnings of the franchise as well as the nature of the protagonist: Estelle Bright — an energetic, upbeat, carefree and oftentimes naïve young woman whos sets out on her own personal journey to discover her own identity, claim her title and uncover the truth and history of the world she lives in alongside her adoptive brother: Joshua Bright: the deuteragonist of the story.The theme and tone of this story is expressed through lively jazz and orchestration (which I am a huge fan of personally; this is still my favorite soundtrack in the series). The composers behind this games tracks are the Falcom Sound Team jdk which, at the time, was made of up the following composers/arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Wataru Ishibashi, Takahide Murayama, Maiko Hattori, Kohei Wada and Yukihiro Jindo.Sora No Kiseki [Composers: Hayato Sonoda and Wataru Ishibashi]— This serves as the title and opening track of the game as well as the entire series. This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika).Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game. (If you’re a fan of JRPGs you know that the main battle theme is what you hear throughout the majority of the game so it’s important to nail this track and they succeeded without a doubt. I’d heard this song floating around on the internet for YEARS without knowing it was from this game and you might have as well if you’re a fan of JRPGs).In my eyes, this track has always represents Estelle’s personality as well as her perception of combat. Estelle is a playful, upbeat and energetic character so most evenly matched fights are fun in her eyes and viewed as a chance to test her skills.The Byway of Departure [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — While ‘Sora No Kiseki’ represents the beginning of the franchise as a whole, ‘The Byway of Departure’ represents and sets the tone for the humble beginnings of Estelle Bright herself and the start of her journey.A Cat Relaxing in the Sun* [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the theme for some of the rural/slower paced towns throughout the game as well as scenes where the party relaxes. This song represents the tone for the majority of the Kingdom of Liberl’s population which is important for worldbuilding across the series as a whole (more on this later). [Side Note: This is one of my favorite songs in the franchise! I have a huge soft spot for this song because it set the tone for the summer I first experienced Trails in the Sky].Seaport City of Ruan [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — No analysis here. This ones just a banger.Hoshi no Arika* (The Whereabouts of Light) [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the ending theme and leitmotiv of the entire Sky Trilogy and is diegetic (meaning this song exists and is performed in the world of the game). This song holds narrative significance on top of being tonally distinct when compared to the rest of the soundtrack.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky SCTrails in the Sky SC (Sora No Kiseki SC) (2006)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails in the Sky SC follows Estelle Bright once again but this time she’s searching for something she’s recently lost in the events of Trails in the Sky. As a result of this, the tone of the soundtrack has drastically changed and has gotten much heavier and emotional. While the jazz influence that made up the previous games soundtrack is still present, the tempos been brought down to give most of the tracks a more saudade tone to represent this part of Estelle’s personal growth and journey.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky SC: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Wataru Ishibashi, Kohei Wada, Yukihiro Jindo and Takahide Murayama.Looking Up at the Sky*** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]: — After the events of the first game, Estelle sees that she’s not anywhere near as strong enough to continue her journey and decides to train so she takes a few months to dedicate herself to it. This overworld theme is the first track that plays after she goes through that process of self discovery, training and growth and sets out on her journey once again. When compared to ‘The Byway of Departure’ (the previous overworld theme that represented Trails in the Sky’s start of journey) you can hear a world of difference in tone, even without playing the game yourself.This is Estelle’s growth between FC and SC manifested into one track. (This is also another variation of ‘The Whereabouts of Bonds’)Feelings Soar with the Wind* (SC Version) [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] —This is a follow-up to the track in the original Trails in the Sky track with the same name. This version is in A Major (where the original is in C# Minor). This is another variation of the The Whereabouts of Light and it plays every time Estelle travelling in an airship. (I personally think of this as Estelle’s theme which is why I added it).The Whereabouts of Bonds [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]—This song plays during the MANY payoffs and emotional scenes throughout Trails in the Sky SC. Phenomenal song.Silver Will (Super Arrange Version) [Composers: Original composer: Wataru Ishibashi | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This one is kind of cheating because it was originally a ‘Trails in the Sky’ song but the payoff for this song is in this game. Plus this version is amazing.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky the 3rdTrails in the Sky the 3rd (Sora No Kiseki the 3rd) (2007)Trails in the Sky the 3rd is one of the most unique sequels I’ve ever experienced. It takes place in an entirely different dimension from the rest of the franchise and the events of this game were written to develop the characters and world of the Trails franchise. The soundtrack reflects the atmosphere and tone of traveling through an unknown dimension perfectly. On top of that, this games protagonists relationship is reflected throughout the games soundtrack through leitmotivs once again. (This is the best Trails game/soundtrack, let’s talk about that).The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky the 3rd: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita and Yukihiro Jindo.A Faint Glitter of Light [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — As the main menu theme of the game, ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ pulls the player into the world, atmosphere and tone of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. It’s apparent that this game is not going the be like the previous two based off of this opening track alone.Jade Corridor [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — Similar to ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ is one of the first songs you hear upon entering this new dimension. This sets the tone for the rest of this unique entry in the Trails franchise.Determination of Fight [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — The battle theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. This song brings back the upbeat and energetic style that every main battle theme had up until this point in the series. To get into english teacher level of over-analysis: The reverb being present in the beginning of the song and fading out as the song progresses represents the party becoming more acquainted with this strange dimension. A stretch…? Maybe.Overdosing Heavenly Bliss [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — This is another obligatory banger entry since I’m biased towards this game. (Plus I think that the title of this track is incredible).Cry for me, cry for you* [Composers: Ryo Takeshita | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This song is the opening of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. Another obligatory banger and one of the best vocal themes in the series.Looking Up at the Sky (Ending Version)** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo]: This song is not only the ending theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, but the ending theme of the Trails in the Sky Trilogy as a whole. This song represents the “end” of every characters involved in this arcs personal journey. (This is also another variation of the original Trails in the Sky SC song). I’ve definitely shed tears to this song a few times not gonna lie.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails from ZeroTrails from Zero (Zero No Kiseki) (2010)Trails from Zero begins a duology of games called the Crossbell arc. This shifts the party and cast from the group of rural, countryside areas featured in the Trails in the Sky Arc to a group of young police officers protecting the bustling modern city of Crossbell and fighting for their freedom. Crossbell City [really] is a city within the province of Crossbell that has adopted top of the line modern technology in their everyday lives. It is located between Liberl (the kingdom lived in and explored throughout the entirety of the Sky arc) and Erebonia and, as a result, has become a melting pot which is reflected in the soundtrack. Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section).Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro JindoAfternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc).Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint.Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc. With the party being a group that patrols in Crossbell City, there is rarely any time to rest. The mining village of Mainz is as developed and, as a result, is more laid back by nature. This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects.Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well.Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series).Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology.Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x. This is a banger.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails to AzureTrails to Azure (Ao No Kiseki) (2011)Similar to the themes expressed in the ‘Get over the Barrier!’ and ‘Inevitable Struggle’ points, Trails to Azure is a game about people taking action to defend and reclaim their personal freedom as well as their homelands freedom. Similar to Trails in the Sky SC, there is a stark change in tone in this game due to the rising political tensions throughout Crossbell.The composers and arrangers for Trails to Azure were the same as Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Yuzo KoshihiroA Barrier to Get Over [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This song uses the leitmotiv of Trails from Zero’s battle theme “Get Over The Barrier!”. This is a more somber interpretation of the track which represents the change in tone from Trails from Zero to Trails to Azure. This theme that previously represented action has turned to a theme of defeat.The Truth of the Rainy Day [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This theme plays when it rains in Crossbell and during some heavy flashback scenes throughout the game. This further adds to the theme of defeat and dejection throughout the game.The Azure Arbitrator [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]— This is the final boss theme of the game. Not much to say, just another bangerPress enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold SteelTrails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki) (2013)Trails of Cold Steel begins a new arc in the Trails saga called the Erebonia arc. This sees the protagonist, Rean Schwarzer, and his classmates (called Class VII) joining an Erebonian military academy. At first the game portrays the military academy almost as if it were just high school where romance can bloom and everyone can be friends and have fun between classes (this is not the reality of it as it is still a military academy). The soundtrack reflects this lighthearted tone at times but quickly gets serious as the games plot develops and the characters are thrown into the reality of their situation.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Noriyuki KamikuraAfterschool Hours [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is played whenever Class VII is let out of class for the day and allowed to spend free time on campus as they please. This song reflects the early carefree nature of the students.The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays during intimate moments between Class VII. This song is representative of the theme of Trails of Cold Steel as the story has a big focus on building the bonds between the students of Class VII.Whereabouts of Feelings [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — Similar to theme of ‘The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’, ‘Whereabouts of Feelings’ plays when the Class VII members tell their backstory, further deepening the bonds they’ve created with each other.Land of Blue Skies [Composers: Saki Momiyama]— This song plays when Class VII visit the homeland of one of their foreign students, Gaius. This part of the game is many students’ first time experiencing other cultures which I think is also important for the overall theme of the series.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel IITrails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II) (2014)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails of Cold Steel II sees Rean and Class VII being forcibly separated from each other after the events of Trails of Cold Steel. The soundtrack reflects the feeling of isolation, division and the struggle to reunite as a class wonderfully.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Yukihiro Jindo and Masanori OsakiWintry Arrival [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as Rean attempts to navigate through the wintry region of Ymir alone on the verge of freezing and starving to death. This is one of the first times he’s had to truly fight without his Class VII members and that tone is expressed through this track.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]To the Irreplaceable People [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel II’s The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’ and ‘Whereabouts of Feelings‘ from a thematic perspective. This song is played whenever the Class VII members reunite and deepen their bonds.For Those We Hold Dear, For Those We Love [Composer: Hayato Sonoda] — This song plays in a scene where all the Class VII members are finally able to fully emotionally process what they’ve gone through together as military students.Plot Spoilers: Blue Destination [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — Obligatory banger track. One of the hardest tracks in the series. (Play the game to find out what this song represents, don’t spoil yourself in any comments).[End of Plot Spoilers]Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel 3Trails of Cold Steel III (Sen no Kiseki III) (2017)Minor Early Plot Spoilers (I’d still suggest reading this one though): Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean and Class VII post-timeskip as working class adults (I have an entire video on ‘Aging Characters in Video Games’ if you’re interested in this topic). Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean teaching his own students called the ‘New Class VII’ at the military academy. From a thematic standpoint, this game starts out in a time of relative peace (probably the most peaceful the series has been since the original Trails in the Sky) and the music reflects that. I would also say that this soundtrack represents Rean and Class VII getting older and looking back nostalgically on the good times and hardships they experienced while attending the academy.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Toshiharu Okajima, Mitsuo Singa and Yukihiro JindoTakahiro Unisuga was in his bag with this soundtrack.Start Line [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — The title theme of Trails of Cold Steel III. This song represents a new chapter in life for Rean as well as both the Old and the New Class VII.Genial and Balmy** [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — That’s a good song right there. I’d say this is an extension of what ‘Start Line’ represents and the overall atmosphere of Trails of Cold Steel III. Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm.Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII.Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’.(The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned)ConclusionOverall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts. There are some minor details throughout the soundtracks aside from the more overt thematic connections such as the morse code message in Trails the 3rd’s soundtrack and some details related to music theory that I could write about if you’re interested.Thanks for reading and play Trails!Follow Me On TwitterSubscribe To My YouTubeMore Articles From Me An Intro & Analysis of the Music of the Trails/Kiseki FranchiseAnalyzing the themes & composers behind the Trails/Kiseki soundtracksBLACKDISC15 min read·Mar 3, 2022--ListenShareThe Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise (also known as ‘Kiseki’ in Japan) is a series of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) developed by Nihon Falcom.

This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika).Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game.

Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section).Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro JindoAfternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc).Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint.Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc.

This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects.Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well.Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series).Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology.Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x. This is a banger.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails to AzureTrails to Azure (Ao No Kiseki) (2011)Similar to the themes expressed in the ‘Get over the Barrier!’ and ‘Inevitable Struggle’ points, Trails to Azure is a game about people taking action to defend and reclaim their personal freedom as well as their homelands freedom. Similar to Trails in the Sky SC, there is a stark change in tone in this game due to the rising political tensions throughout Crossbell.The composers and arrangers for Trails to Azure were the same as Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Yuzo KoshihiroA Barrier to Get Over [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This song uses the leitmotiv of Trails from Zero’s battle theme “Get Over The Barrier!”. This is a more somber interpretation of the track which represents the change in tone from Trails from Zero to Trails to Azure. This theme that previously represented action has turned to a theme of defeat.The Truth of the Rainy Day [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This theme plays when it rains in Crossbell and during some heavy flashback scenes throughout the game. This further adds to the theme of defeat and dejection throughout the game.The Azure Arbitrator [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]— This is the final boss theme of the game. Not much to say, just another bangerPress enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold SteelTrails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki) (2013)Trails of Cold Steel begins a new arc in the Trails saga called the Erebonia arc. This sees the protagonist, Rean Schwarzer, and his classmates (called Class VII) joining an Erebonian military academy. At first the game portrays the military academy almost as if it were just high school where romance can bloom and everyone can be friends and have fun between classes (this is not the reality of it as it is still a military academy). The soundtrack reflects this lighthearted tone at times but quickly gets serious as the games plot develops and the characters are thrown into the reality of their situation.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Noriyuki KamikuraAfterschool Hours [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is played whenever Class VII is let out of class for the day and allowed to spend free time on campus as they please. This song reflects the early carefree nature of the students.The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays during intimate moments between Class VII. This song is representative of the theme of Trails of Cold Steel as the story has a big focus on building the bonds between the students of Class VII.Whereabouts of Feelings [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — Similar to theme of ‘The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’, ‘Whereabouts of Feelings’ plays when the Class VII members tell their backstory, further deepening the bonds they’ve created with each other.Land of Blue Skies [Composers: Saki Momiyama]— This song plays when Class VII visit the homeland of one of their foreign students, Gaius. This part of the game is many students’ first time experiencing other cultures which I think is also important for the overall theme of the series.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel IITrails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II) (2014)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails of Cold Steel II sees Rean and Class VII being forcibly separated from each other after the events of Trails of Cold Steel. The soundtrack reflects the feeling of isolation, division and the struggle to reunite as a class wonderfully.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Yukihiro Jindo and Masanori OsakiWintry Arrival [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as Rean attempts to navigate through the wintry region of Ymir alone on the verge of freezing and starving to death. This is one of the first times he’s had to truly fight without his Class VII members and that tone is expressed through this track.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]To the Irreplaceable People [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel II’s The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’ and ‘Whereabouts of Feelings‘ from a thematic perspective. This song is played whenever the Class VII members reunite and deepen their bonds.For Those We Hold Dear, For Those We Love [Composer: Hayato Sonoda] — This song plays in a scene where all the Class VII members are finally able to fully emotionally process what they’ve gone through together as military students.Plot Spoilers: Blue Destination [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — Obligatory banger track. One of the hardest tracks in the series. (Play the game to find out what this song represents, don’t spoil yourself in any comments).[End of Plot Spoilers]Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel 3Trails of Cold Steel III (Sen no Kiseki III) (2017)Minor Early Plot Spoilers (I’d still suggest reading this one though): Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean and Class VII post-timeskip as working class adults (I have an entire video on ‘Aging Characters in Video Games’ if you’re interested in this topic). Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean teaching his own students called the ‘New Class VII’ at the military academy. From a thematic standpoint, this game starts out in a time of relative peace (probably the most peaceful the series has been since the original Trails in the Sky) and the music reflects that. I would also say that this soundtrack represents Rean and Class VII getting older and looking back nostalgically on the good times and hardships they experienced while attending the academy.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Toshiharu Okajima, Mitsuo Singa and Yukihiro JindoTakahiro Unisuga was in his bag with this soundtrack.Start Line [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — The title theme of Trails of Cold Steel III. This song represents a new chapter in life for Rean as well as both the Old and the New Class VII.Genial and Balmy** [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — That’s a good song right there. I’d say this is an extension of what ‘Start Line’ represents and the overall atmosphere of Trails of Cold Steel III. Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm.Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII.Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’.(The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned)ConclusionOverall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts. There are some minor details throughout the soundtracks aside from the more overt thematic connections such as the morse code message in Trails the 3rd’s soundtrack and some details related to music theory that I could write about if you’re interested.Thanks for reading and play Trails!Follow Me On TwitterSubscribe To My YouTubeMore Articles From Me An Intro & Analysis of the Music of the Trails/Kiseki FranchiseAnalyzing the themes & composers behind the Trails/Kiseki soundtracksBLACKDISC15 min read·Mar 3, 2022--ListenShareThe Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise (also known as ‘Kiseki’ in Japan) is a series of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) developed by Nihon Falcom. Each games’ soundtrack across the franchise hosts a diverse range of music and genres that fully represent the tone and narrative of their respective stories, themes and characters. This article aims to introduce those that may not know about this series as well as existing fans of the series to some of the standout tracks and the composers behind them as well as analyze the soundtracks from a thematic and narrative point of view. Falcom and its community do a great job of crediting its composers, artists and arrangers so if there’s a specific track you like it’s not difficult to find songs of similar structure.Note: This article is best experienced by listening to this youtube playlist while reading. Also, I have only played up to Trails of Cold Steel III as of writing this so that is as far as the article will cover for now. I’ve marked my personal favorite songs with an asterisk*Spoilers will kept to a minimum and will be marked otherwise. If you prefer to go into games 100% blind I suggest you skip the first paragraph in each section as they cover how the soundtracks reflect the tone, plot and themes of the games. Otherwise this article is completely spoiler free.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the SkyThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Sora No Kiseki) (2004)Also known as Trails in the Sky FC, this is the first chapter of the saga and the start of the Sky/Liberl arc. This soundtrack represents the humble beginnings of the franchise as well as the nature of the protagonist: Estelle Bright — an energetic, upbeat, carefree and oftentimes naïve young woman whos sets out on her own personal journey to discover her own identity, claim her title and uncover the truth and history of the world she lives in alongside her adoptive brother: Joshua Bright: the deuteragonist of the story.The theme and tone of this story is expressed through lively jazz and orchestration (which I am a huge fan of personally; this is still my favorite soundtrack in the series). The composers behind this games tracks are the Falcom Sound Team jdk which, at the time, was made of up the following composers/arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Wataru Ishibashi, Takahide Murayama, Maiko Hattori, Kohei Wada and Yukihiro Jindo.Sora No Kiseki [Composers: Hayato Sonoda and Wataru Ishibashi]— This serves as the title and opening track of the game as well as the entire series. This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika).Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game. (If you’re a fan of JRPGs you know that the main battle theme is what you hear throughout the majority of the game so it’s important to nail this track and they succeeded without a doubt. I’d heard this song floating around on the internet for YEARS without knowing it was from this game and you might have as well if you’re a fan of JRPGs).In my eyes, this track has always represents Estelle’s personality as well as her perception of combat. Estelle is a playful, upbeat and energetic character so most evenly matched fights are fun in her eyes and viewed as a chance to test her skills.The Byway of Departure [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — While ‘Sora No Kiseki’ represents the beginning of the franchise as a whole, ‘The Byway of Departure’ represents and sets the tone for the humble beginnings of Estelle Bright herself and the start of her journey.A Cat Relaxing in the Sun* [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the theme for some of the rural/slower paced towns throughout the game as well as scenes where the party relaxes. This song represents the tone for the majority of the Kingdom of Liberl’s population which is important for worldbuilding across the series as a whole (more on this later). [Side Note: This is one of my favorite songs in the franchise! I have a huge soft spot for this song because it set the tone for the summer I first experienced Trails in the Sky].Seaport City of Ruan [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — No analysis here. This ones just a banger.Hoshi no Arika* (The Whereabouts of Light) [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the ending theme and leitmotiv of the entire Sky Trilogy and is diegetic (meaning this song exists and is performed in the world of the game). This song holds narrative significance on top of being tonally distinct when compared to the rest of the soundtrack.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky SCTrails in the Sky SC (Sora No Kiseki SC) (2006)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails in the Sky SC follows Estelle Bright once again but this time she’s searching for something she’s recently lost in the events of Trails in the Sky. As a result of this, the tone of the soundtrack has drastically changed and has gotten much heavier and emotional. While the jazz influence that made up the previous games soundtrack is still present, the tempos been brought down to give most of the tracks a more saudade tone to represent this part of Estelle’s personal growth and journey.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky SC: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Wataru Ishibashi, Kohei Wada, Yukihiro Jindo and Takahide Murayama.Looking Up at the Sky*** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]: — After the events of the first game, Estelle sees that she’s not anywhere near as strong enough to continue her journey and decides to train so she takes a few months to dedicate herself to it. This overworld theme is the first track that plays after she goes through that process of self discovery, training and growth and sets out on her journey once again. When compared to ‘The Byway of Departure’ (the previous overworld theme that represented Trails in the Sky’s start of journey) you can hear a world of difference in tone, even without playing the game yourself.This is Estelle’s growth between FC and SC manifested into one track. (This is also another variation of ‘The Whereabouts of Bonds’)Feelings Soar with the Wind* (SC Version) [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] —This is a follow-up to the track in the original Trails in the Sky track with the same name. This version is in A Major (where the original is in C# Minor). This is another variation of the The Whereabouts of Light and it plays every time Estelle travelling in an airship. (I personally think of this as Estelle’s theme which is why I added it).The Whereabouts of Bonds [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]—This song plays during the MANY payoffs and emotional scenes throughout Trails in the Sky SC. Phenomenal song.Silver Will (Super Arrange Version) [Composers: Original composer: Wataru Ishibashi | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This one is kind of cheating because it was originally a ‘Trails in the Sky’ song but the payoff for this song is in this game. Plus this version is amazing.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky the 3rdTrails in the Sky the 3rd (Sora No Kiseki the 3rd) (2007)Trails in the Sky the 3rd is one of the most unique sequels I’ve ever experienced. It takes place in an entirely different dimension from the rest of the franchise and the events of this game were written to develop the characters and world of the Trails franchise. The soundtrack reflects the atmosphere and tone of traveling through an unknown dimension perfectly. On top of that, this games protagonists relationship is reflected throughout the games soundtrack through leitmotivs once again. (This is the best Trails game/soundtrack, let’s talk about that).The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky the 3rd: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita and Yukihiro Jindo.A Faint Glitter of Light [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — As the main menu theme of the game, ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ pulls the player into the world, atmosphere and tone of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. It’s apparent that this game is not going the be like the previous two based off of this opening track alone.Jade Corridor [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — Similar to ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ is one of the first songs you hear upon entering this new dimension. This sets the tone for the rest of this unique entry in the Trails franchise.Determination of Fight [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — The battle theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. This song brings back the upbeat and energetic style that every main battle theme had up until this point in the series. To get into english teacher level of over-analysis: The reverb being present in the beginning of the song and fading out as the song progresses represents the party becoming more acquainted with this strange dimension. A stretch…? Maybe.Overdosing Heavenly Bliss [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — This is another obligatory banger entry since I’m biased towards this game. (Plus I think that the title of this track is incredible).Cry for me, cry for you* [Composers: Ryo Takeshita | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This song is the opening of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. Another obligatory banger and one of the best vocal themes in the series.Looking Up at the Sky (Ending Version)** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo]: This song is not only the ending theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, but the ending theme of the Trails in the Sky Trilogy as a whole. This song represents the “end” of every characters involved in this arcs personal journey. (This is also another variation of the original Trails in the Sky SC song). I’ve definitely shed tears to this song a few times not gonna lie.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails from ZeroTrails from Zero (Zero No Kiseki) (2010)Trails from Zero begins a duology of games called the Crossbell arc. This shifts the party and cast from the group of rural, countryside areas featured in the Trails in the Sky Arc to a group of young police officers protecting the bustling modern city of Crossbell and fighting for their freedom. Crossbell City [really] is a city within the province of Crossbell that has adopted top of the line modern technology in their everyday lives. It is located between Liberl (the kingdom lived in and explored throughout the entirety of the Sky arc) and Erebonia and, as a result, has become a melting pot which is reflected in the soundtrack. Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section).Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro JindoAfternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc).Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint.Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc. With the party being a group that patrols in Crossbell City, there is rarely any time to rest. The mining village of Mainz is as developed and, as a result, is more laid back by nature. This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects.Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well.Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series).Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology.Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x.

(This is also another variation of ‘The Whereabouts of Bonds’)Feelings Soar with the Wind* (SC Version) [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] —This is a follow-up to the track in the original Trails in the Sky track with the same name. This version is in A Major (where the original is in C# Minor). This is another variation of the The Whereabouts of Light and it plays every time Estelle travelling in an airship. (I personally think of this as Estelle’s theme which is why I added it).The Whereabouts of Bonds [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]—This song plays during the MANY payoffs and emotional scenes throughout Trails in the Sky SC. Phenomenal song.Silver Will (Super Arrange Version) [Composers: Original composer: Wataru Ishibashi | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This one is kind of cheating because it was originally a ‘Trails in the Sky’ song but the payoff for this song is in this game. Plus this version is amazing.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky the 3rdTrails in the Sky the 3rd (Sora No Kiseki the 3rd) (2007)Trails in the Sky the 3rd is one of the most unique sequels I’ve ever experienced. It takes place in an entirely different dimension from the rest of the franchise and the events of this game were written to develop the characters and world of the Trails franchise. The soundtrack reflects the atmosphere and tone of traveling through an unknown dimension perfectly. On top of that, this games protagonists relationship is reflected throughout the games soundtrack through leitmotivs once again. (This is the best Trails game/soundtrack, let’s talk about that).The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky the 3rd: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita and Yukihiro Jindo.A Faint Glitter of Light [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — As the main menu theme of the game, ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ pulls the player into the world, atmosphere and tone of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. It’s apparent that this game is not going the be like the previous two based off of this opening track alone.Jade Corridor [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — Similar to ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ is one of the first songs you hear upon entering this new dimension. This sets the tone for the rest of this unique entry in the Trails franchise.Determination of Fight [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — The battle theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. This song brings back the upbeat and energetic style that every main battle theme had up until this point in the series. To get into english teacher level of over-analysis: The reverb being present in the beginning of the song and fading out as the song progresses represents the party becoming more acquainted with this strange dimension. A stretch…? Maybe.Overdosing Heavenly Bliss [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — This is another obligatory banger entry since I’m biased towards this game. (Plus I think that the title of this track is incredible).Cry for me, cry for you* [Composers: Ryo Takeshita | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This song is the opening of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. Another obligatory banger and one of the best vocal themes in the series.Looking Up at the Sky (Ending Version)** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo]: This song is not only the ending theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, but the ending theme of the Trails in the Sky Trilogy as a whole. This song represents the “end” of every characters involved in this arcs personal journey. (This is also another variation of the original Trails in the Sky SC song). I’ve definitely shed tears to this song a few times not gonna lie.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails from ZeroTrails from Zero (Zero No Kiseki) (2010)Trails from Zero begins a duology of games called the Crossbell arc. This shifts the party and cast from the group of rural, countryside areas featured in the Trails in the Sky Arc to a group of young police officers protecting the bustling modern city of Crossbell and fighting for their freedom. Crossbell City [really] is a city within the province of Crossbell that has adopted top of the line modern technology in their everyday lives. It is located between Liberl (the kingdom lived in and explored throughout the entirety of the Sky arc) and Erebonia and, as a result, has become a melting pot which is reflected in the soundtrack. Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section).Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro JindoAfternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc).Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint.Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc. With the party being a group that patrols in Crossbell City, there is rarely any time to rest. The mining village of Mainz is as developed and, as a result, is more laid back by nature. This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects.Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well.Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series).Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology.Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x. This is a banger.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails to AzureTrails to Azure (Ao No Kiseki) (2011)Similar to the themes expressed in the ‘Get over the Barrier!’ and ‘Inevitable Struggle’ points, Trails to Azure is a game about people taking action to defend and reclaim their personal freedom as well as their homelands freedom. Similar to Trails in the Sky SC, there is a stark change in tone in this game due to the rising political tensions throughout Crossbell.The composers and arrangers for Trails to Azure were the same as Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Yuzo KoshihiroA Barrier to Get Over [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This song uses the leitmotiv of Trails from Zero’s battle theme “Get Over The Barrier!”. This is a more somber interpretation of the track which represents the change in tone from Trails from Zero to Trails to Azure. This theme that previously represented action has turned to a theme of defeat.The Truth of the Rainy Day [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This theme plays when it rains in Crossbell and during some heavy flashback scenes throughout the game. This further adds to the theme of defeat and dejection throughout the game.The Azure Arbitrator [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]— This is the final boss theme of the game. Not much to say, just another bangerPress enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold SteelTrails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki) (2013)Trails of Cold Steel begins a new arc in the Trails saga called the Erebonia arc. This sees the protagonist, Rean Schwarzer, and his classmates (called Class VII) joining an Erebonian military academy. At first the game portrays the military academy almost as if it were just high school where romance can bloom and everyone can be friends and have fun between classes (this is not the reality of it as it is still a military academy). The soundtrack reflects this lighthearted tone at times but quickly gets serious as the games plot develops and the characters are thrown into the reality of their situation.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Noriyuki KamikuraAfterschool Hours [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is played whenever Class VII is let out of class for the day and allowed to spend free time on campus as they please. This song reflects the early carefree nature of the students.The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays during intimate moments between Class VII. This song is representative of the theme of Trails of Cold Steel as the story has a big focus on building the bonds between the students of Class VII.Whereabouts of Feelings [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — Similar to theme of ‘The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’, ‘Whereabouts of Feelings’ plays when the Class VII members tell their backstory, further deepening the bonds they’ve created with each other.Land of Blue Skies [Composers: Saki Momiyama]— This song plays when Class VII visit the homeland of one of their foreign students, Gaius. This part of the game is many students’ first time experiencing other cultures which I think is also important for the overall theme of the series.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel IITrails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II) (2014)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails of Cold Steel II sees Rean and Class VII being forcibly separated from each other after the events of Trails of Cold Steel. The soundtrack reflects the feeling of isolation, division and the struggle to reunite as a class wonderfully.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Yukihiro Jindo and Masanori OsakiWintry Arrival [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as Rean attempts to navigate through the wintry region of Ymir alone on the verge of freezing and starving to death. This is one of the first times he’s had to truly fight without his Class VII members and that tone is expressed through this track.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]To the Irreplaceable People [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel II’s The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’ and ‘Whereabouts of Feelings‘ from a thematic perspective. This song is played whenever the Class VII members reunite and deepen their bonds.For Those We Hold Dear, For Those We Love [Composer: Hayato Sonoda] — This song plays in a scene where all the Class VII members are finally able to fully emotionally process what they’ve gone through together as military students.Plot Spoilers: Blue Destination [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — Obligatory banger track. One of the hardest tracks in the series. (Play the game to find out what this song represents, don’t spoil yourself in any comments).[End of Plot Spoilers]Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel 3Trails of Cold Steel III (Sen no Kiseki III) (2017)Minor Early Plot Spoilers (I’d still suggest reading this one though): Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean and Class VII post-timeskip as working class adults (I have an entire video on ‘Aging Characters in Video Games’ if you’re interested in this topic). Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean teaching his own students called the ‘New Class VII’ at the military academy. From a thematic standpoint, this game starts out in a time of relative peace (probably the most peaceful the series has been since the original Trails in the Sky) and the music reflects that. I would also say that this soundtrack represents Rean and Class VII getting older and looking back nostalgically on the good times and hardships they experienced while attending the academy.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Toshiharu Okajima, Mitsuo Singa and Yukihiro JindoTakahiro Unisuga was in his bag with this soundtrack.Start Line [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — The title theme of Trails of Cold Steel III. This song represents a new chapter in life for Rean as well as both the Old and the New Class VII.Genial and Balmy** [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — That’s a good song right there. I’d say this is an extension of what ‘Start Line’ represents and the overall atmosphere of Trails of Cold Steel III. Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm.Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII.Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’.(The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned)ConclusionOverall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts. There are some minor details throughout the soundtracks aside from the more overt thematic connections such as the morse code message in Trails the 3rd’s soundtrack and some details related to music theory that I could write about if you’re interested.Thanks for reading and play Trails!Follow Me On TwitterSubscribe To My YouTubeMore Articles From Me An Intro & Analysis of the Music of the Trails/Kiseki FranchiseAnalyzing the themes & composers behind the Trails/Kiseki soundtracksBLACKDISC15 min read·Mar 3, 2022--ListenShareThe Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise (also known as ‘Kiseki’ in Japan) is a series of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) developed by Nihon Falcom. Each games’ soundtrack across the franchise hosts a diverse range of music and genres that fully represent the tone and narrative of their respective stories, themes and characters. This article aims to introduce those that may not know about this series as well as existing fans of the series to some of the standout tracks and the composers behind them as well as analyze the soundtracks from a thematic and narrative point of view. Falcom and its community do a great job of crediting its composers, artists and arrangers so if there’s a specific track you like it’s not difficult to find songs of similar structure.Note: This article is best experienced by listening to this youtube playlist while reading. Also, I have only played up to Trails of Cold Steel III as of writing this so that is as far as the article will cover for now. I’ve marked my personal favorite songs with an asterisk*Spoilers will kept to a minimum and will be marked otherwise. If you prefer to go into games 100% blind I suggest you skip the first paragraph in each section as they cover how the soundtracks reflect the tone, plot and themes of the games. Otherwise this article is completely spoiler free.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the SkyThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Sora No Kiseki) (2004)Also known as Trails in the Sky FC, this is the first chapter of the saga and the start of the Sky/Liberl arc. This soundtrack represents the humble beginnings of the franchise as well as the nature of the protagonist: Estelle Bright — an energetic, upbeat, carefree and oftentimes naïve young woman whos sets out on her own personal journey to discover her own identity, claim her title and uncover the truth and history of the world she lives in alongside her adoptive brother: Joshua Bright: the deuteragonist of the story.The theme and tone of this story is expressed through lively jazz and orchestration (which I am a huge fan of personally; this is still my favorite soundtrack in the series). The composers behind this games tracks are the Falcom Sound Team jdk which, at the time, was made of up the following composers/arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Wataru Ishibashi, Takahide Murayama, Maiko Hattori, Kohei Wada and Yukihiro Jindo.Sora No Kiseki [Composers: Hayato Sonoda and Wataru Ishibashi]— This serves as the title and opening track of the game as well as the entire series. This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika).Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game. (If you’re a fan of JRPGs you know that the main battle theme is what you hear throughout the majority of the game so it’s important to nail this track and they succeeded without a doubt. I’d heard this song floating around on the internet for YEARS without knowing it was from this game and you might have as well if you’re a fan of JRPGs).In my eyes, this track has always represents Estelle’s personality as well as her perception of combat. Estelle is a playful, upbeat and energetic character so most evenly matched fights are fun in her eyes and viewed as a chance to test her skills.The Byway of Departure [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — While ‘Sora No Kiseki’ represents the beginning of the franchise as a whole, ‘The Byway of Departure’ represents and sets the tone for the humble beginnings of Estelle Bright herself and the start of her journey.A Cat Relaxing in the Sun* [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the theme for some of the rural/slower paced towns throughout the game as well as scenes where the party relaxes. This song represents the tone for the majority of the Kingdom of Liberl’s population which is important for worldbuilding across the series as a whole (more on this later). [Side Note: This is one of my favorite songs in the franchise! I have a huge soft spot for this song because it set the tone for the summer I first experienced Trails in the Sky].Seaport City of Ruan [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — No analysis here. This ones just a banger.Hoshi no Arika* (The Whereabouts of Light) [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the ending theme and leitmotiv of the entire Sky Trilogy and is diegetic (meaning this song exists and is performed in the world of the game). This song holds narrative significance on top of being tonally distinct when compared to the rest of the soundtrack.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky SCTrails in the Sky SC (Sora No Kiseki SC) (2006)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails in the Sky SC follows Estelle Bright once again but this time she’s searching for something she’s recently lost in the events of Trails in the Sky. As a result of this, the tone of the soundtrack has drastically changed and has gotten much heavier and emotional. While the jazz influence that made up the previous games soundtrack is still present, the tempos been brought down to give most of the tracks a more saudade tone to represent this part of Estelle’s personal growth and journey.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky SC: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Wataru Ishibashi, Kohei Wada, Yukihiro Jindo and Takahide Murayama.Looking Up at the Sky*** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]: — After the events of the first game, Estelle sees that she’s not anywhere near as strong enough to continue her journey and decides to train so she takes a few months to dedicate herself to it. This overworld theme is the first track that plays after she goes through that process of self discovery, training and growth and sets out on her journey once again. When compared to ‘The Byway of Departure’ (the previous overworld theme that represented Trails in the Sky’s start of journey) you can hear a world of difference in tone, even without playing the game yourself.This is Estelle’s growth between FC and SC manifested into one track.

Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm.Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII.Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’.(The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned)ConclusionOverall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts. There are some minor details throughout the soundtracks aside from the more overt thematic connections such as the morse code message in Trails the 3rd’s soundtrack and some details related to music theory that I could write about if you’re interested.Thanks for reading and play Trails!Follow Me On TwitterSubscribe To My YouTubeMore Articles From Me An Intro & Analysis of the Music of the Trails/Kiseki FranchiseAnalyzing the themes & composers behind the Trails/Kiseki soundtracksBLACKDISC15 min read·Mar 3, 2022--ListenShareThe Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise (also known as ‘Kiseki’ in Japan) is a series of JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) developed by Nihon Falcom. Each games’ soundtrack across the franchise hosts a diverse range of music and genres that fully represent the tone and narrative of their respective stories, themes and characters. This article aims to introduce those that may not know about this series as well as existing fans of the series to some of the standout tracks and the composers behind them as well as analyze the soundtracks from a thematic and narrative point of view. Falcom and its community do a great job of crediting its composers, artists and arrangers so if there’s a specific track you like it’s not difficult to find songs of similar structure.Note: This article is best experienced by listening to this youtube playlist while reading. Also, I have only played up to Trails of Cold Steel III as of writing this so that is as far as the article will cover for now. I’ve marked my personal favorite songs with an asterisk*Spoilers will kept to a minimum and will be marked otherwise. If you prefer to go into games 100% blind I suggest you skip the first paragraph in each section as they cover how the soundtracks reflect the tone, plot and themes of the games. Otherwise this article is completely spoiler free.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the SkyThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Sora No Kiseki) (2004)Also known as Trails in the Sky FC, this is the first chapter of the saga and the start of the Sky/Liberl arc. This soundtrack represents the humble beginnings of the franchise as well as the nature of the protagonist: Estelle Bright — an energetic, upbeat, carefree and oftentimes naïve young woman whos sets out on her own personal journey to discover her own identity, claim her title and uncover the truth and history of the world she lives in alongside her adoptive brother: Joshua Bright: the deuteragonist of the story.The theme and tone of this story is expressed through lively jazz and orchestration (which I am a huge fan of personally; this is still my favorite soundtrack in the series). The composers behind this games tracks are the Falcom Sound Team jdk which, at the time, was made of up the following composers/arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Wataru Ishibashi, Takahide Murayama, Maiko Hattori, Kohei Wada and Yukihiro Jindo.Sora No Kiseki [Composers: Hayato Sonoda and Wataru Ishibashi]— This serves as the title and opening track of the game as well as the entire series. This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika).Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game. (If you’re a fan of JRPGs you know that the main battle theme is what you hear throughout the majority of the game so it’s important to nail this track and they succeeded without a doubt. I’d heard this song floating around on the internet for YEARS without knowing it was from this game and you might have as well if you’re a fan of JRPGs).In my eyes, this track has always represents Estelle’s personality as well as her perception of combat. Estelle is a playful, upbeat and energetic character so most evenly matched fights are fun in her eyes and viewed as a chance to test her skills.The Byway of Departure [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — While ‘Sora No Kiseki’ represents the beginning of the franchise as a whole, ‘The Byway of Departure’ represents and sets the tone for the humble beginnings of Estelle Bright herself and the start of her journey.A Cat Relaxing in the Sun* [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the theme for some of the rural/slower paced towns throughout the game as well as scenes where the party relaxes. This song represents the tone for the majority of the Kingdom of Liberl’s population which is important for worldbuilding across the series as a whole (more on this later). [Side Note: This is one of my favorite songs in the franchise! I have a huge soft spot for this song because it set the tone for the summer I first experienced Trails in the Sky].Seaport City of Ruan [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — No analysis here. This ones just a banger.Hoshi no Arika* (The Whereabouts of Light) [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the ending theme and leitmotiv of the entire Sky Trilogy and is diegetic (meaning this song exists and is performed in the world of the game). This song holds narrative significance on top of being tonally distinct when compared to the rest of the soundtrack.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky SCTrails in the Sky SC (Sora No Kiseki SC) (2006)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails in the Sky SC follows Estelle Bright once again but this time she’s searching for something she’s recently lost in the events of Trails in the Sky. As a result of this, the tone of the soundtrack has drastically changed and has gotten much heavier and emotional. While the jazz influence that made up the previous games soundtrack is still present, the tempos been brought down to give most of the tracks a more saudade tone to represent this part of Estelle’s personal growth and journey.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky SC: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Wataru Ishibashi, Kohei Wada, Yukihiro Jindo and Takahide Murayama.Looking Up at the Sky*** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]: — After the events of the first game, Estelle sees that she’s not anywhere near as strong enough to continue her journey and decides to train so she takes a few months to dedicate herself to it. This overworld theme is the first track that plays after she goes through that process of self discovery, training and growth and sets out on her journey once again. When compared to ‘The Byway of Departure’ (the previous overworld theme that represented Trails in the Sky’s start of journey) you can hear a world of difference in tone, even without playing the game yourself.This is Estelle’s growth between FC and SC manifested into one track. (This is also another variation of ‘The Whereabouts of Bonds’)Feelings Soar with the Wind* (SC Version) [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] —This is a follow-up to the track in the original Trails in the Sky track with the same name. This version is in A Major (where the original is in C# Minor). This is another variation of the The Whereabouts of Light and it plays every time Estelle travelling in an airship. (I personally think of this as Estelle’s theme which is why I added it).The Whereabouts of Bonds [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]—This song plays during the MANY payoffs and emotional scenes throughout Trails in the Sky SC. Phenomenal song.Silver Will (Super Arrange Version) [Composers: Original composer: Wataru Ishibashi | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This one is kind of cheating because it was originally a ‘Trails in the Sky’ song but the payoff for this song is in this game. Plus this version is amazing.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails in the Sky the 3rdTrails in the Sky the 3rd (Sora No Kiseki the 3rd) (2007)Trails in the Sky the 3rd is one of the most unique sequels I’ve ever experienced. It takes place in an entirely different dimension from the rest of the franchise and the events of this game were written to develop the characters and world of the Trails franchise. The soundtrack reflects the atmosphere and tone of traveling through an unknown dimension perfectly. On top of that, this games protagonists relationship is reflected throughout the games soundtrack through leitmotivs once again. (This is the best Trails game/soundtrack, let’s talk about that).The composers and arrangers of Trails in the Sky the 3rd: Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita and Yukihiro Jindo.A Faint Glitter of Light [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — As the main menu theme of the game, ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ pulls the player into the world, atmosphere and tone of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. It’s apparent that this game is not going the be like the previous two based off of this opening track alone.Jade Corridor [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — Similar to ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ is one of the first songs you hear upon entering this new dimension. This sets the tone for the rest of this unique entry in the Trails franchise.Determination of Fight [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — The battle theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. This song brings back the upbeat and energetic style that every main battle theme had up until this point in the series. To get into english teacher level of over-analysis: The reverb being present in the beginning of the song and fading out as the song progresses represents the party becoming more acquainted with this strange dimension. A stretch…? Maybe.Overdosing Heavenly Bliss [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — This is another obligatory banger entry since I’m biased towards this game. (Plus I think that the title of this track is incredible).Cry for me, cry for you* [Composers: Ryo Takeshita | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This song is the opening of Trails in the Sky the 3rd. Another obligatory banger and one of the best vocal themes in the series.Looking Up at the Sky (Ending Version)** [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga | Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo]: This song is not only the ending theme of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, but the ending theme of the Trails in the Sky Trilogy as a whole. This song represents the “end” of every characters involved in this arcs personal journey. (This is also another variation of the original Trails in the Sky SC song). I’ve definitely shed tears to this song a few times not gonna lie.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails from ZeroTrails from Zero (Zero No Kiseki) (2010)Trails from Zero begins a duology of games called the Crossbell arc. This shifts the party and cast from the group of rural, countryside areas featured in the Trails in the Sky Arc to a group of young police officers protecting the bustling modern city of Crossbell and fighting for their freedom. Crossbell City [really] is a city within the province of Crossbell that has adopted top of the line modern technology in their everyday lives. It is located between Liberl (the kingdom lived in and explored throughout the entirety of the Sky arc) and Erebonia and, as a result, has become a melting pot which is reflected in the soundtrack. Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section).Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro JindoAfternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc).Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint.Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc. With the party being a group that patrols in Crossbell City, there is rarely any time to rest. The mining village of Mainz is as developed and, as a result, is more laid back by nature. This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects.Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well.Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series).Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology.Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x. This is a banger.Edit 2023: This section has been adapted and expanded into a YouTube video essay! :)Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails to AzureTrails to Azure (Ao No Kiseki) (2011)Similar to the themes expressed in the ‘Get over the Barrier!’ and ‘Inevitable Struggle’ points, Trails to Azure is a game about people taking action to defend and reclaim their personal freedom as well as their homelands freedom. Similar to Trails in the Sky SC, there is a stark change in tone in this game due to the rising political tensions throughout Crossbell.The composers and arrangers for Trails to Azure were the same as Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Yuzo KoshihiroA Barrier to Get Over [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This song uses the leitmotiv of Trails from Zero’s battle theme “Get Over The Barrier!”. This is a more somber interpretation of the track which represents the change in tone from Trails from Zero to Trails to Azure. This theme that previously represented action has turned to a theme of defeat.The Truth of the Rainy Day [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This theme plays when it rains in Crossbell and during some heavy flashback scenes throughout the game. This further adds to the theme of defeat and dejection throughout the game.The Azure Arbitrator [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]— This is the final boss theme of the game. Not much to say, just another bangerPress enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold SteelTrails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki) (2013)Trails of Cold Steel begins a new arc in the Trails saga called the Erebonia arc. This sees the protagonist, Rean Schwarzer, and his classmates (called Class VII) joining an Erebonian military academy. At first the game portrays the military academy almost as if it were just high school where romance can bloom and everyone can be friends and have fun between classes (this is not the reality of it as it is still a military academy). The soundtrack reflects this lighthearted tone at times but quickly gets serious as the games plot develops and the characters are thrown into the reality of their situation.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Noriyuki KamikuraAfterschool Hours [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is played whenever Class VII is let out of class for the day and allowed to spend free time on campus as they please. This song reflects the early carefree nature of the students.The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays during intimate moments between Class VII. This song is representative of the theme of Trails of Cold Steel as the story has a big focus on building the bonds between the students of Class VII.Whereabouts of Feelings [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — Similar to theme of ‘The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’, ‘Whereabouts of Feelings’ plays when the Class VII members tell their backstory, further deepening the bonds they’ve created with each other.Land of Blue Skies [Composers: Saki Momiyama]— This song plays when Class VII visit the homeland of one of their foreign students, Gaius. This part of the game is many students’ first time experiencing other cultures which I think is also important for the overall theme of the series.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel IITrails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II) (2014)Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails of Cold Steel II sees Rean and Class VII being forcibly separated from each other after the events of Trails of Cold Steel. The soundtrack reflects the feeling of isolation, division and the struggle to reunite as a class wonderfully.The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Yukihiro Jindo and Masanori OsakiWintry Arrival [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as Rean attempts to navigate through the wintry region of Ymir alone on the verge of freezing and starving to death. This is one of the first times he’s had to truly fight without his Class VII members and that tone is expressed through this track.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]To the Irreplaceable People [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel II’s The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’ and ‘Whereabouts of Feelings‘ from a thematic perspective. This song is played whenever the Class VII members reunite and deepen their bonds.For Those We Hold Dear, For Those We Love [Composer: Hayato Sonoda] — This song plays in a scene where all the Class VII members are finally able to fully emotionally process what they’ve gone through together as military students.Plot Spoilers: Blue Destination [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — Obligatory banger track. One of the hardest tracks in the series. (Play the game to find out what this song represents, don’t spoil yourself in any comments).[End of Plot Spoilers]Press enter or click to view image in full sizeTrails of Cold Steel 3Trails of Cold Steel III (Sen no Kiseki III) (2017)Minor Early Plot Spoilers (I’d still suggest reading this one though): Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean and Class VII post-timeskip as working class adults (I have an entire video on ‘Aging Characters in Video Games’ if you’re interested in this topic). Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean teaching his own students called the ‘New Class VII’ at the military academy. From a thematic standpoint, this game starts out in a time of relative peace (probably the most peaceful the series has been since the original Trails in the Sky) and the music reflects that. I would also say that this soundtrack represents Rean and Class VII getting older and looking back nostalgically on the good times and hardships they experienced while attending the academy.[End of Minor Plot Spoilers]The composers and arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Toshiharu Okajima, Mitsuo Singa and Yukihiro JindoTakahiro Unisuga was in his bag with this soundtrack.Start Line [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — The title theme of Trails of Cold Steel III. This song represents a new chapter in life for Rean as well as both the Old and the New Class VII.Genial and Balmy** [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — That’s a good song right there. I’d say this is an extension of what ‘Start Line’ represents and the overall atmosphere of Trails of Cold Steel III. Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm.Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII.Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’.(The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned)ConclusionOverall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts.

Press enter or click to view image in full size The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Sora No Kiseki) (2004) Also known as Trails in the Sky FC, this is the first chapter of the saga and the start of the Sky/Liberl arc. This soundtrack represents the humble beginnings of the franchise as well as the nature of the protagonist: Estelle Bright — an energetic, upbeat, carefree and oftentimes naïve young woman whos sets out on her own personal journey to discover her own identity, claim her title and uncover the truth and history of the world she lives in alongside her adoptive brother: Joshua Bright: the deuteragonist of the story. The theme and tone of this story is expressed through lively jazz and orchestration (which I am a huge fan of personally; this is still my favorite soundtrack in the series). The composers behind this games tracks are the Falcom Sound Team jdk which, at the time, was made of up the following composers/arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Wataru Ishibashi, Takahide Murayama, Maiko Hattori, Kohei Wada and Yukihiro Jindo. Sora No Kiseki [Composers: Hayato Sonoda and Wataru Ishibashi]— This serves as the title and opening track of the game as well as the entire series. This song represents the first chapter of the 25+ year story being told throughout the Trails franchise. This also introduces the leitmotif of the Sky Arc (first trilogy of the series): ‘The Whereabouts of Light’ (or Hoshi no Arika). Sophisticated Fight [Composers: Wataru Ishibashi] — This is the battle theme of the game. (If you’re a fan of JRPGs you know that the main battle theme is what you hear throughout the majority of the game so it’s important to nail this track and they succeeded without a doubt. I’d heard this song floating around on the internet for YEARS without knowing it was from this game and you might have as well if you’re a fan of JRPGs). In my eyes, this track has always represents Estelle’s personality as well as her perception of combat.

A Cat Relaxing in the Sun* [Composers: Hayato Sonoda] — This is the theme for some of the rural/slower paced towns throughout the game as well as scenes where the party relaxes.

This overworld theme is the first track that plays after she goes through that process of self discovery, training and growth and sets out on her journey once again. When compared to ‘The Byway of Departure’ (the previous overworld theme that represented Trails in the Sky’s start of journey) you can hear a world of difference in tone, even without playing the game yourself.

The soundtrack reflects the atmosphere and tone of traveling through an unknown dimension perfectly.

It’s apparent that this game is not going the be like the previous two based off of this opening track alone. Jade Corridor [Composers: Ryo Takeshita] — Similar to ‘A Faint Glitter of Light’ is one of the first songs you hear upon entering this new dimension.

Press enter or click to view image in full size Trails from Zero (Zero No Kiseki) (2010) Trails from Zero begins a duology of games called the Crossbell arc. This shifts the party and cast from the group of rural, countryside areas featured in the Trails in the Sky Arc to a group of young police officers protecting the bustling modern city of Crossbell and fighting for their freedom. Crossbell City [really] is a city within the province of Crossbell that has adopted top of the line modern technology in their everyday lives. It is located between Liberl (the kingdom lived in and explored throughout the entirety of the Sky arc) and Erebonia and, as a result, has become a melting pot which is reflected in the soundtrack. Trails from Zero’s soundtrack represents the shift in environment along with the personal themes of each of the games central party members; who are a part of a police section called the SSS (Special Support Section). Two new composers and arrangers were added to the team for Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga and Yukihiro Jindo Afternoon in Crossbell [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as you explore the majority of Crossbell City and reflects the tone and environment well. Crossbell City is in the afternoon can be a laidback location that feels relatively safe to its citizens. The synths represent the technological background of the city (which was rarely presented throughout the Sky arc). Geofront [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The Geofront is a location that is (quite literally) central to the plot of the game as well as the location of Crossbell City. It’s also a great track from a musically technical standpoint. Mining Village of Mainz* [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — As I said earlier, Crossbell City can be quite busy for the SSS when compared to the locations in the Sky arc. With the party being a group that patrols in Crossbell City, there is rarely any time to rest. The mining village of Mainz is as developed and, as a result, is more laid back by nature. This allows the party a rare chance to rest due to the stark change of pace this location brings, which this song beautifully reflects. Throughout the game the SSS fights and [inevitably] struggle, oftentimes towards a devastating loss. This theme reminds me of the times where the SSS allowed themselves to sit down and reflect on those losses and I feel it reflects the SSS’s individual struggles as well. Someday, Surely* [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga] — Someday, Surely represents the hope that the SSS and Crossbell as a province carry for their own personal futures. This song also plays during the emotional scenes throughout the game. (The Super Arrange version… powerful. One of the best songs in the series). Get Over The Barrier! [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — The main battle theme of Trails from Zero. Where most of the songs I’ve referenced have been about future hopes, present struggles and longing for freedom. ‘Get Over The Barrier’ represents taking action towards ones own freedom. This song represents the party’s resilience in the face of adversity in the fight towards their freedom throughout the Crossbell duology. Inevitable Struggle [Composers: Masanori Osaki |Arrangement: Yukihiro Jindo] — This is the second battle theme of Trails from Zero. This song represents the same thing as ‘Get Over The Barrier’ but amplified 100x. This is a banger. Press enter or click to view image in full size Trails to Azure (Ao No Kiseki) (2011) Similar to the themes expressed in the ‘Get over the Barrier!’ and ‘Inevitable Struggle’ points, Trails to Azure is a game about people taking action to defend and reclaim their personal freedom as well as their homelands freedom. Similar to Trails in the Sky SC, there is a stark change in tone in this game due to the rising political tensions throughout Crossbell. The composers and arrangers for Trails to Azure were the same as Trails from Zero: Masanori Osaki, Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Ryo Takeshita, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Yuzo Koshihiro A Barrier to Get Over [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This song uses the leitmotiv of Trails from Zero’s battle theme “Get Over The Barrier!”. This is a more somber interpretation of the track which represents the change in tone from Trails from Zero to Trails to Azure. This theme that previously represented action has turned to a theme of defeat. The Truth of the Rainy Day [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — This theme plays when it rains in Crossbell and during some heavy flashback scenes throughout the game. This further adds to the theme of defeat and dejection throughout the game. The Azure Arbitrator [Composers: Takahiro Unisuga]— This is the final boss theme of the game. Not much to say, just another banger Press enter or click to view image in full size Trails of Cold Steel (Sen no Kiseki) (2013) Trails of Cold Steel begins a new arc in the Trails saga called the Erebonia arc. This sees the protagonist, Rean Schwarzer, and his classmates (called Class VII) joining an Erebonian military academy. At first the game portrays the military academy almost as if it were just high school where romance can bloom and everyone can be friends and have fun between classes (this is not the reality of it as it is still a military academy). The soundtrack reflects this lighthearted tone at times but quickly gets serious as the games plot develops and the characters are thrown into the reality of their situation. The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Atsushi Shirakawa, Yukihiro Jindo and Noriyuki Kamikura Afterschool Hours [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is played whenever Class VII is let out of class for the day and allowed to spend free time on campus as they please. This song reflects the early carefree nature of the students. The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays during intimate moments between Class VII. This song is representative of the theme of Trails of Cold Steel as the story has a big focus on building the bonds between the students of Class VII. Whereabouts of Feelings [Composers: Saki Momiyama] — Similar to theme of ‘The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’, ‘Whereabouts of Feelings’ plays when the Class VII members tell their backstory, further deepening the bonds they’ve created with each other. Land of Blue Skies [Composers: Saki Momiyama]— This song plays when Class VII visit the homeland of one of their foreign students, Gaius. This part of the game is many students’ first time experiencing other cultures which I think is also important for the overall theme of the series. Press enter or click to view image in full size Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II) (2014) Minor Plot Spoilers: Trails of Cold Steel II sees Rean and Class VII being forcibly separated from each other after the events of Trails of Cold Steel. The soundtrack reflects the feeling of isolation, division and the struggle to reunite as a class wonderfully. The composers and arrangers: Saki Momiyama, Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga, Tomokatsu Hagiuda, Toshiharu Okajima, Yukihiro Jindo and Masanori Osaki Wintry Arrival [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song plays as Rean attempts to navigate through the wintry region of Ymir alone on the verge of freezing and starving to death. This is one of the first times he’s had to truly fight without his Class VII members and that tone is expressed through this track. [End of Minor Plot Spoilers] To the Irreplaceable People [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel II’s The Sound of Rainfall in the Academy’ and ‘Whereabouts of Feelings‘ from a thematic perspective. This song is played whenever the Class VII members reunite and deepen their bonds. For Those We Hold Dear, For Those We Love [Composer: Hayato Sonoda] — This song plays in a scene where all the Class VII members are finally able to fully emotionally process what they’ve gone through together as military students. Plot Spoilers: Blue Destination [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — Obligatory banger track. One of the hardest tracks in the series. (Play the game to find out what this song represents, don’t spoil yourself in any comments). [End of Plot Spoilers] Press enter or click to view image in full size Trails of Cold Steel III (Sen no Kiseki III) (2017) Minor Early Plot Spoilers (I’d still suggest reading this one though): Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean and Class VII post-timeskip as working class adults (I have an entire video on ‘Aging Characters in Video Games’ if you’re interested in this topic). Trails of Cold Steel III sees Rean teaching his own students called the ‘New Class VII’ at the military academy. From a thematic standpoint, this game starts out in a time of relative peace (probably the most peaceful the series has been since the original Trails in the Sky) and the music reflects that. I would also say that this soundtrack represents Rean and Class VII getting older and looking back nostalgically on the good times and hardships they experienced while attending the academy. [End of Minor Plot Spoilers] The composers and arrangers: Hayato Sonoda, Toshiharu Okajima, Mitsuo Singa and Yukihiro Jindo Takahiro Unisuga was in his bag with this soundtrack. Start Line [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — The title theme of Trails of Cold Steel III. This song represents a new chapter in life for Rean as well as both the Old and the New Class VII. Genial and Balmy** [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — That’s a good song right there. I’d say this is an extension of what ‘Start Line’ represents and the overall atmosphere of Trails of Cold Steel III. Genial means friendly and cheerful and balmy means pleasantly warm. Things to Tell You [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song represents the nostalgia and longing that characters feel throughout this game but especially Old Class VII. Things Entrusted [Composer: Takahiro Unisuga] — This song is Trails of Cold Steel III’s ‘To the Irreplaceable People’. (The sections for Trails of Cold Steel IV and onward will be added as I finish the games, stay tuned) Overall, the Trails/Kiseki franchise has always been on top of reflecting it’s themes and plots through its narratives and the composers behind the songs are masters of their crafts. There are some minor details throughout the soundtracks aside from the more overt thematic connections such as the morse code message in Trails the 3rd’s soundtrack and some details related to music theory that I could write about if you’re interested.
