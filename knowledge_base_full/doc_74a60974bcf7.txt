Edgar Breed: Mixed Breed | Adopted 2018 Rescued If you see photos of Pedro Pascal with an adorable Yoda-eared dog, it’s Edgar. Edgar was a shelter dog Pascal fostered and ended up keeping for a few years in the late 2010s. Pascal said Edgar didn’t enjoy moving around so much for his work, so he had to rehome him but said he found him the perfect place. He first shared Edgar on Instagram in February 2018 with the caption “I think it’s a dog”. Pascal hasn’t said when, but we estimate he rehomed Edgar around 2020. Pascal was also photographed by paparazzi while walking him. Credit: @pascalispunk/Instagram Gretta Breed: Mixed Breed | Adopted 2001 Rescued The love of Pedro Pascal’s life was a Pitbull-American Staffordshire Terrier mix breed named Gretta. In 2001, he adopted her while living in New York as he struggled to launch his acting career. Pascal said he was going through a really tough time after 9/11 and that when he was too broke to afford food, friends who ran a cheesecake bakery would give him and Gretta gourmet cheesecake to eat. Pascal posted a tribute on Instagram to Gretta when she passed away in December 2013 at the age of 12. I’ve always had this weird worry that while I do love dogs generally, I’ll never get over Greta. No other dog will live up to her! -Pedro Pascal, Flaunt Magazine, March 2023 In a March 2023 interview with Flaunt Magazine, Pescal said this when asked about Gretta, “Her name was Greta. She was like a Pit mixed with an American Staffordshire Terrier. She was the most attractive f*cking dog. She was like a seal with floppy ears, and this kind of, it wasn’t black and white, but espresso, almost purple brown [coat] with a white river that separated her temple, a snow-white neck and a pig pink belly, these white socks, and this little white tip at the tip of her tail. she was such a hottie. She was the coolest dog, man.” and, “It was rough. I felt so bad for her. She was the love of my life actually. People in the neighborhood would help me out and walk her when I was doing a double shift, brunch and dinner in Times Square, which was quite a schlep from Red Hook.” For photos and more of Gretta, check out Pascal’s revealing 2025 interview with Vanity Fair.

Pascal posted a tribute on Instagram to Gretta when she passed away in December 2013 at the age of 12. I’ve always had this weird worry that while I do love dogs generally, I’ll never get over Greta. No other dog will live up to her! -Pedro Pascal, Flaunt Magazine, March 2023 In a March 2023 interview with Flaunt Magazine, Pescal said this when asked about Gretta, “Her name was Greta. She was like a Pit mixed with an American Staffordshire Terrier. She was the most attractive f*cking dog. She was like a seal with floppy ears, and this kind of, it wasn’t black and white, but espresso, almost purple brown [coat] with a white river that separated her temple, a snow-white neck and a pig pink belly, these white socks, and this little white tip at the tip of her tail. she was such a hottie. She was the coolest dog, man.” and, “It was rough. I felt so bad for her. She was the love of my life actually. People in the neighborhood would help me out and walk her when I was doing a double shift, brunch and dinner in Times Square, which was quite a schlep from Red Hook.” For photos and more of Gretta, check out Pascal’s revealing 2025 interview with Vanity Fair.
