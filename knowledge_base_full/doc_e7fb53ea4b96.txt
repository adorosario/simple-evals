News ArcTanGent Festival Announces First Bands‏ January 12, 2013 ArcTanGent Festival Announces First Bands‏ ArcTanGent, the new Bristol based music festival from the organisers of the award winning 2000trees has today announced the first 14 bands for its line up. The 5,000 capacity festival will play host to headliner 65daysofstatic plus Three Trapped Tigers, Tall Ships, Rolo Tomassi, Maybeshewill, Johnny Foreigner, Castrovalva, Yndi Halda, This Town Needs Guns, That Fucking Tank, The Physics House Band, Among Brothers, Axes and Brontide. Says co-*-founder James Scarlett: “with ArcTanGent we wanted to take the festival template we’ve laid down with 2000trees and have more leftfield, experimental and post-*-rock orientated bands. We think that this first line up announcement gives our audience an idea of where we are coming from musically and there are loads more exciting bands to come over the next few months!” Ric Phethean of Tall Ships says: “2000trees is the king of vibes. The two years we’ve played have been two of the best shows we’ve ever done -*- great bands, good times. It’s the only festival we make sure we can play and then stay for the rest of the weekend, so we really can’t wait for ArcTanGent!” This sentiment is echoed by John Helps of Maybeshewill who says that “2000trees is easily one of our favourite UK Festivals so it’s an absolute privilege to be asked to be involved in their new event. The rest of the line-*-up we’ve seen so far is exceptional, and we’re hugely excited that we get to play the first one.” ArcTanGent takes places from 29th – 31st August and tickets are on sale now priced at £59. Fellow organiser Goc O’Callaghan says: “we’ve done the research and we are pretty much the best priced festival out there. You’ll get two nights camping, four stages, over 70 incredible bands & DJs and the best local food & drink we can find. It’s definitely great value!” For more information visit www.arctangent.co.uk ArcTanGent, the new Bristol based music festival from the organisers of the award winning 2000trees has today announced the first 14 bands for its line up.
