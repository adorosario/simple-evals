Some canny Mumbai bowling strangled the scoring rate early on, and despite a determined 57 from Dwayne Smith, Chennai crumbled to 161 for eight.The Super Kings chose to field after winning the toss, and MS Dhoniâ€™s decision looked vindicated after an early breakthrough. Parthiv Patel was run out off just the fifth ball of the match, giving Chennai an early fillip of momentum.However, the subsequent 119-run partnership between Simmons and Sharma took the match away from the Super Kings. The West Indies man was more reserved in his play initially, while the skipper had a license to tee off.Quinn Rooney/Getty ImagesAs cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle noted, Sharma counterattacked with a swagger after the worst possible start to the Mumbai innings:When he departed in the 12th over for 50, Mumbai were brilliantly set on 120 for two, but Simmons played a critical role too. The Caribbean star bludgeoned 68 from just 45 balls, including eight fours and a trio of sixes.Hagen Hopkins/Getty ImagesIt was the kind of innings that has become increasingly commonplace for Simmons, as noted by Freddie Wilde of ESPN Cricinfo:Although Simmonsâ€™ departure just a ball after Sharmaâ€™s gave Chennai some hope, a couple of more brilliant cameos kept the Indians on the front foot. Kieron Pollard was at his destructive best in an 18-ball 36, while Ambati Rayudu notched an unbeaten 36 from 24 balls.As noted by Broken Cricket, Pollard is a man who seems to relish the big moments:His late flourish helped Mumbai post an imposing total of 202 for five from their 20 overs, and although Chennai boast a batting lineup containing some of the worldâ€™s most dynamic players, chasing it down in an IPL final would have represented an astounding achievement.They really struggled for impetus in the opening exchanges. Although Mumbai werenâ€™t prolific in their wicket-taking, economical bowling from Lasith Malinga kept the scoring under wraps, and when chasing a target of 203 from just 120 balls, it doesnâ€™t take long for the rate to accelerate to stratospheric levels when the runs dry up.Rajanish Kakade/Associated PressWith a successful run chase looking unlikely at the 10-over mark, with the Super Kings on a meagre 67 for one, former India player Aakash Chopra was lamenting Dhoniâ€™s decision to bowl first:Things really took a turn for the worse when Smithâ€”who played well for his 57â€”was pinned in front by Harbhajan Singh. The veteran spinner then had Suresh Raina stumped for 28, and in the next over the dangerous Dwayne Bravo holed out for just nine off the bowling of Mitchell McClenaghan. Gurinder Osan/Associated PressAt 108 for four in the 15th over and a required rate of circa 18 runs an over, it was a massive ask for Chennai; Malinga bowling Dhoni for 18 was the final nail in the Super Kings' coffin. Chennai unravelled from that point, stuttering to 161 for eight and giving Mumbai a comfortable 41-run win in the tournament finale.As Wilde noted, it was a marvelous showing from the new champions:This squad of Mumbai players have gelled superbly in the weeks leading up to the final, and the luxury of having some extra rest ahead of this match certainly showed in a sharp display. Having players like Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting as part of the coaching staff will have surely contributed to the Indians' noticeable big match temperament too.By comparison, Chennai looked a little fatigued in all facets of their game. Losing Brendon McCullum late in the tournament represented a major blow to their chances, and although this is a group used to winning this competition, the Super Kings supporters can be proud of the overall effort their men put in throughout the tournament. 34:11 Fantasy Football DailyTOP NEWS2025 NFL Week 3 Expert PicksBleacher Report12hPower Rankings at the Start of Training Camp ðŸ“ŠBleacher Report12hRookies That Already Look Like StealsBleacher Report11h1 Dream Trade for Jays ðŸ”„Bleacher Report1dKD Lost Bitcoin Password ðŸ˜‚Bleacher Report3hTRENDING ON B/RBleacher Reportâ€¢3hA'ja Wilson, Alanna Smith Make History as 2025 WNBA Co-Defensive Players of the YearBleacher Reportâ€¢4hYankees vs. Blue Jays 2026 London Series Canceled by MLB Due to Scheduling Issues2026 matchup between Yankees and Blue Jays no longer happening due to scheduling issues (AP)Bleacher Reportâ€¢5hLeBron James Says He's 'Not Hinting' at Anything amid Lakers, NBA Retirement RumorsBleacher Reportâ€¢12hBiggest Week 3 Fantasy Football 2025 Sleepers at Every PositionBleacher Reportâ€¢5hAngel Reese's 1st Reebok Signature Shoe Sells out Hours After Going on SaleReese posts after two colorways fly off shelves ðŸ“¸TRENDING ON B/RBleacher Reportâ€¢3hA'ja Wilson, Alanna Smith Make History as 2025 WNBA Co-Defensive Players of the YearBleacher Reportâ€¢4hYankees vs. Blue Jays 2026 London Series Canceled by MLB Due to Scheduling Issues2026 matchup between Yankees and Blue Jays no longer happening due to scheduling issues (AP)Bleacher Reportâ€¢5hLeBron James Says He's 'Not Hinting' at Anything amid Lakers, NBA Retirement RumorsBleacher Reportâ€¢12hBiggest Week 3 Fantasy Football 2025 Sleepers at Every PositionBleacher Reportâ€¢5hAngel Reese's 1st Reebok Signature Shoe Sells out Hours After Going on SaleReese posts after two colorways fly off shelves ðŸ“¸ JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA - OCTOBER 20: Kieron Pollard of Mumbai hits a six during the Karbonn Smart CLT20 match between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians at Bidvest Wanderers Stadium on October 20, 2012 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
