News ArcTanGent Announce Headliner‏ February 16, 2013 ArcTanGent Announce Headliner‏ ArcTanGent Festival Announces Headliner ArcTanGent Festival has today announced that Friday night headliners 65daysofstatic will be joined on the Saturday by experimental electronic duo Fuck Buttons. Says co-founder James Scarlett; “we’ve been working on booking Fuck Buttons for months now and I’m ecstatic that it’s finally come off. They’re a great band for us to book because they fit the line-up perfectly, rarely play live and have close connections with Bristol after forming and basing themselves here.” Other bands added to the bill are Future of the Left, And So I Watch You From Afar, Islet, Bo Ningen, Gallops, Turbowolf, Arcane Roots, Blacklisters, You Slut! and Talons. They will join the long list of acts already announced, including Three Trapped Tigers, Tall Ships, Rolo Tomassi, Maybeshewill, Johnny Foreigner, Castrovalva, Yndi Halda, This Town Needs Guns, That Fucking Tank, The Physics House Band, Among Brothers, Axes and Brontide. James continues: “The really great thing about this latest announcement is that it adds another dimension to our line up. Bands like Turbowolf and Future of the Left bring something a bit different to the table and Bo Ningen are from another planet entirely ‐ right now they’re the best live band in the UK bar none!” And it’s not just the organisers that are excited. Rob Jones from 65daysofstatic says: ” We loved headlining 2000 trees last year so couldn’t resist the chance to play at their new festival. The line- up looks incredible- We’re very excited!” This sentiment is echoed by Ric Phethean of Tall Ships who says that “I’ve always loved the events put on by the organisers so we’re really looking forward to playing. We love so many of the bands they’ve booked. So I’m certainly planning on hanging around all weekend!” ArcTanGent is the new 5,000 capacity Bristol based music festival from the organisers of the award winning 2000trees. It takes place from 29th-31st August and tickets are on sale at £59. Fellow organiser Goc O’Callaghan says: “we’ve done the research and we are pretty much the best priced festival out there. You’ll get two nights camping, four stages, over 70 incredible bands & DJs and the best local food and drink we can find. It’s definitely great value!” http://www.arctangent.co.uk ArcTanGent Festival Announces Headliner ArcTanGent Festival has today announced that Friday night headliners 65daysofstatic will be joined on the Saturday by experimental electronic duo Fuck Buttons.
