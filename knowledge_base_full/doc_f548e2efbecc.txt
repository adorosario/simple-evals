Soul Arrow, coupled with the Royal's high Magic, one-shots most early enemies, and can be used indefinitely if the player waits for the Fragrant Ring to regenerate MP. Royals can cast a generous amount of Spells in succession due to their high MP pool, a product of their high Intelligence and the Silver Coronet and Silver Catalyst starting equipment, which grant a collective bonus of +40% MP. When melee combat is necessary, Royals can attack with their Rapier from behind the safety of their shield, counteracting their low Vitality. The only threat to a Royal is attacks from several foes in cramped spaces, where they cannot effectively use ranged Magic or block successive attacks without having their guard broken, a consequence of their low Endurance. The Royal's initial Soul Level of 1 allows maximum versatality when leveling up Cost to acquire the starting equipment and consumables included: 4,900 souls.
