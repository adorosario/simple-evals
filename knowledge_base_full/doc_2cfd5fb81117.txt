Prof. Dr. M. G. ‹KEDA (1926 - 2003) Turk J Math 27 (2003) , 461 { 471. (cid:13)c TU¨BI_TAK Professor Masatoshi Gu¨ndu¨z Ikeda: A Life Devoted to Mathematics Cemal Koc(cid:24) In the summer of 1963 as a new graduate I paid a visit to the newly established Mathematics Department of Ege University, in I_zmir, to apply for a post. In the very moments of my arrival, they introduced to me a young faculty member: Doctor Ikeda. Apparently he was Japanese, polite yet authoritative, and there was an air of general admiration about him; however the rest was a complete mystery for me. I complied with his suggestions and brought a few more documents to support my application,and thus completed the application process and joined the department. My (cid:12)rst duty there was to assist his lectures. However, this was not as easy as I had expected. One of his two courses was totally unfamiliar to me; the other one in turn was a course of which I covered much less as an undergraduate than had been taught by Dr. Ikeda. My ability to keep up with the subject was slowed by the fact that the books in Turkish or French I had access to were too few, causing me to consult desperately all the existing books thoroughly. The professor gave no credit for the clich(cid:19)e \az olsun ama tam olsun" (let it be little but complete) which is commonly used by lecturers as an excuse for covering limitedteaching material. On the contrary he wouldalwaysprefer to cover manydiverse concepts and techniques with their essential features. Naturallythere were students who are not able to grasp and appreciate this attitude. I remember a student replying to an exam question inwhichthe students were to\giveoutlinesofthe proofofthe factthat a general polynomialof degree greater than or equal to (cid:12)ve cannot be solved by radicals" with the answer \God is so great that he will allow someone in the future to make it possible." Hislectures includedneitherunnecessary material,norunnecessary ornaments and digressions. He was meticulous about the content and rigorous in his lectures. On 461 KOC(cid:24) a day in 1968, vexed by the students movements, I remember him reprimanding his students, \I am not supposed to lecture colored, Turkish, nor cinemascope," referring to the many cinema advertisements that had been appearing everywhere then. Not to be misunderstood, I must emphasize that he had neither di(cid:14)culty in lecturing nor in writingo(cid:14)cialletters andreports inTurkish. Further, inlater yearsIalsowitnessed him inserting Turkish words into their Japanese conversation with his Japanese friends. In a conference he saidthat the languageinwhich he could express himselfbest was Turkish, even though he could fluently speak and write English,German and French|other than his native language. Having been newly established, Ege University was short of facilities, resulting in, amongotherthings,alimitednumberofo(cid:14)cesintheMathematicsDepartment. Thuswe assistantsfoundourselvessharingonesingleo(cid:14)ce. However,intime,thankstoDr. Ikeda, we transformed this o(cid:14)ce to an ongoing seminar room, for we had problems in di(cid:11)erent areas of mathematics and Dr Ikeda was the only one to lend us a hand so benevolently. His generosity and kindheartedness wouldtouch allthe facultyatEge University,aswell asallthemathematicsassistants,inalloftheirdiverseareas,supervisedbyhimselfornot. Hewasevenoftenfoundtobehelpingmanyafacultyapplicanttoassociateprofessorship or professorship in Medicine or Agriculture in their various correlation problems. This remindsmeofoneofhiswittystories. Onadayhewasverybusywithhisownapplication for associate professorship, an applicant from another faculty comes and asks for help about some statistical problems of his thesis. Dr. Ikeda apologies and tries to explain in a polite manner how busy he is with his own associate professorship applicationand has notimetohelphim. Yetthevisitorinsistsandsays,\butyourapplicationisforassociate professorship where as mine is for professorship; so mine is more important then yours." In 1964 many important events came to pass: he married to Emel Ardor, received Turkish citizenship, changed his name as Masatoshi Gu¨ndu¨z I_keda and, in a relatively short time, was promoted to associate professorship and then to professorship. Masatoshi Ikeda was born on the 25th of February, 1926, in Tokyo as the youngest child of a statistician father and a teacher-mother after two daughters and a son, who passed away in his 20’s. He graduated from Osaka University in 1948, receiving the Rigaku-Shi (B.S.) degree. The same year he took a post at Osaka University and started to study Frobenius and quasi-Frobenius algebras under the supervision of K. 462 KOC(cid:24) Shoda. It was there he encountered a workinggroup of researchers led by T. Nakayama, and joined them. He published his (cid:12)rst paper [1] jointly with T. Nakayama, that characterized Frobenius algebras, and it had been followed by [2] and [3] giving new characterizationsofquasi-FrobeniusalgebrasintermsofShoda’sselfinjectivitycondition. In [4] he generalized a commutativity theorem due to Kaplansky; his main result there wasthesemi-primitivecaseofthewell-knowncommutativitytheoremgivenlateronbyN. Jacobson. In 1954 he published [5],generalizing Gaschu¨tz’s results on group algebras to Frobenius rings. The operator introduced there is known as the Gascu¨tz-Ikeda operator and in symmetric algebras the imageof this operator turns out to be an invariantof the algebra. These papers, togetherwith[6]and[7],constituted hisdoctoraldissertationand he received the Rigaku-Hakushi(Ph.D.)degree fromOsaka University in 1953. His joint paper [6] with Nakayama gives some characteristic properties of quasi-Frobenius rings in terms of annihilators of intersections and it constitutes the source of Ikeda-Nakayama rings introduced in [43] and Ikeda-Nakayama modules in [44]. In a group including T. Nakayama, H. Nagao and later S. Eilenberg, he published a sequence of papers [8, 11, 12] on the cohomologyof algebras. One mightsay his ring theory period continued until 1955. The Algebraic Number Theory Symposium held in Tokyo in 1955 became one of the turning pointsofhislife,forhethen turned his interest tonumber theory anddecided to joinProfessorHasse’sschoolatHamburgUniversity. Between1957and1959hecontinued hisresearch atHamburgUniversityasanAlexandervonHumboldtFoundationfellow. In this period he concentrated on the embedding problem ofGaloistheory and he obtained animportantreductionontheexistence ofstrongsolutionsofa(cid:12)niteembeddingproblem withabeliankernel. TheAlexander vonHumboldtFoundationwasthe second influential item in his life, for besides its fellowship which allowed him to join Hasse’s school, its social activities gave rise to meeting Dr. Emel Ardor, who was also a fellow of the foundation, thus further precipitating his interest in Turkey. Dr. Emel (Ardor) Ikeda recalls his curiosity: \Dr. Ikeda began to show me his interest. He asked me several questions aboutTurkey,Turkish,lifeandcustoms inTurkey. Isoonfoundoutthe reason for this curiosity. His teacher Professor Hasse had visited Turkey a couple of times, he loved Turkey, he had friends and students in Turkey and he was keen on learning Turkish. Further, he met Prof. Orhan I_(cid:24)cen in Hamburg, he knew Cahit Arf by name. 463 KOC(cid:24) [Ikeda] was keen on learning new things; [and] he, too, developed a passion for Turkey andTurkish." (See [45].) ThispassionbroughthimtoI_zmir,Turkeyin1960. Soonafter, he visited I_stanbul University to meet Ord. Prof. Dr. Cahit Arf, who was a former doctoral student of Professor Hasse. This was the beginning of an eternal friendship and a lifetime in Turkey. For a short while he taught statistics at the Medical Faculty of Ege University. In 1961 he joined the newly established Mathematics Department of the Science Faculty where he shouldered all the academic and administrativeduties and loads alone as the head of the Chair of Theoretical Mathematics. Meanwhile, he paid varied visits to Hamburg University, Middle East Technical University in Ankara, and TurkishScienti(cid:12)candTechnicalResearchCouncil(TU¨BI_TAK) presided byProfessor Arf to keep in touch with other colleagues with who he could collaborate. On the last days ofMay1968,Professors C.Arfand R.Laglandsvisited Egeuniversity todeliver talkson the Cartan-Dieudonn(cid:19)e Theorem and Automorphic Forms, respectively. In the May 31st Kar(cid:24)s(cid:16)yaka dinner followingthe talks (also mentioned in an article by Professor Laglands (see [46]), Ikeda was invited to join METU. Another important aspect of this visit is revealed in this article. May it be known that the seeds of Lagland’s Program had been planted in a hotel in Konak, I_zmir during this visit. Up to the end of his stay in I_zmir, the Professor continued his research on the embedding problem, focusing on Grunwald’s Existence theorem. The work appeared in [17] and [18]. In addition, he published a paper [16] on the crossed products of S- (cid:12)elds and he answered a question on Turan inequalities raised by Professor Kochmieder in one departmental seminar inhis paper [19]. The papers [20]and [21],which deal with noncommutative rings, are also products of these years. In August 1968Ikeda movedto Ankara and joined MiddleEast Technical University, as expected. Together with Professor Arf, he took on the mission of establishing a genuine mathematics department, a genuine graduate school of mathematics, with the hope of developing a genuine center of mathematics, where mathematicians educated at METU would take responsibility for establishing new universities and institutions in other cities ofthe country. Part ofthis dreamhas come true, even thought inadi(cid:11)erent, unforeseen form. I am convinced that that the mission of converting this dream into reality, in its every detail, is a most vital legacy and testament to this inseparable pair of mentors. In the late 60’s and 70’s, the most prominent formation was the TU¨BI_TAK 464 KOC(cid:24) Pure Mathematics Unit, presided by Professor Ikeda, although it may be remembered by only a very few today. The aim of this unit was to unite all mathematicians at METU, as wellas inAnkaraand aroundthe country,and those completingtheir Ph.D.’s abroad, around the world, into one single entity, to activate them and thus create a mathematical community,speaking almost the same mathematical language. I feel that this goalhas been achieved in aconsiderable extent. In thisunit every member prepared his own semi-annular project, progressed his or her solutions to problems in the project step-by-step in relatively small seminars and then presented results obtained in weekly departmental seminars. In the 1970’s, the Silivri Research Institute (Silivri Ara(cid:24)st(cid:16)rma Enstitu¨su¨) conferences wereaddedtothepursuitsoftheunit. ThisInstitutewasfounded by the late Professor Naz(cid:16)m Terzio(cid:21)glu who was then the Rector of Istanbul University, anditwastheplacetogatherfortwoorthreeinternationalconferences eachyear. During the period, Professor Ikeda took on the mission of motivating, encouraging and giving suggestions to the members of the unit, while continuing with his own individual and joint problems, on which he obtained remarkable results. He worked on diverse areas of algebra such as algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, the theory of rings, algebras and modules, including also non-Archimedean normed spaces and C*-algebras. At METU, Professor Ikeda had many advantages compared with his previous years in Turkey. He found colleagues to share academic responsibilities, he had no obligation to take on administrative duties except for the reasonable bureaucracy of the Pure Math Research Unit, there were graduate courses and a graduate school concept to improve, and yet there was a rich library open 27/7 and a well-stocked and active bookstore, etc. Publications of this fruitful period includes [22{36] of which I believe [33] was rather special to him. In this paper he proved a conjecture due to Ju¨rgen Neukirch, who was one of Krull’s students and one of the most talented algebra and number theorists of the world,passed awayat an early age. At a meeting atOberwolfah, Professor Neukirch mentionedhisconjecturethatcontinuousgroupautomorphismsoftheGaloisgroupofthe separable closure of the rational number (cid:12)eld probably consists of inner automorphisms. ThisattractedtheProfessor’sattentionalot. He(cid:12)rstprovedin[31]thateverycontinuous group automorphism of the Galois group of the separable closure (or of the solvable closure) of the rational number (cid:12)eld leaves each conjugate class of the Galois group and then he succeeded in [33] to complete the proof of the conjecture. Professor Neukirch 465 KOC(cid:24) regarded Professor Ikeda as his teacher since he impressed and inspired to a large extent by the Professor’s previous works. Being able to conclude a(cid:14)rmatively his \student’s" perfectly formulated striking conjecture pleased the Professor very much. The same conjecture had been proved also independently by Iwasawa and Uchida at the same time. We enjoyed hearing Professor Neukirch’s talk on his own conjecture entitled \The Ikeda-Iwasawa-Uchida Theorem" at a symposium in Silvri in 1975. This symposium, whose participants include Hasse, Arf, Roquette, Neukirch, I_(cid:24)cen, Frey and Geyer, was an important, historical symposium held in Turkey. The unique and natural organizer of such symposiums on algebra and number theory was Professor Ikeda in collaboration with Professor Arf. Mathematicalpursuits ofthis sort tookplaceat the Naz(cid:16)mTerziog(cid:21)lu Research Institute in Silivrithrough to the 1980’s. After a one year stay at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1976, and a short stay at Hacettepe University, he returned again to METU in 1978. No one could expect any favor for mathematics from the hard times of the 1980’s. He visited Yarmouk University in Jordan twice; and in between the two visits, his colleagues at METU requested him to hold the chair of the department. It was a nightmare, but there was noting to do but to lend a hand. Between 1983 and 1985 the Professor’s presence was the only encouragement for the department. Aside from this, he spent most of decade of the 80’s visiting Yarmouk University and Eastern Mediterranean University in North Cyprus. In 1992 he retired andjoinedEasternMediterraneanUniversity. HismaininterestinJordanandCypruswas thehigherorderderivations,whichresultedinthepublicationof[35],andthehomological aspects of algebras. He worked on generalizing di(cid:11)erential modules due to Y. Nakai as Universal Moduleswithrespect ton-cocycles. He alsoworkedonintegraldomainswhose results appeared in [36]and [37]. In 1993he wasinvited byMarmaraResearch Center of TU¨BI_TAK inGebze, I_stanbul,whichhadbeen founded byagroupofscientists including Professor Ikeda, with the hard work of nearly a decade. In the center he headed a small research team who concentrated on cryptography and related topics and published three papers [38], [39] and [40]. In 1997, he moved to the newly established Feza Gu¨rsey Research Institute in Kandili, Istanbul, to concentrate on his number theory problems primarily. Part of the outcome of his work appeared in [41]. Professor Ikeda received the most prestigious awards of Turkey for his outstanding contribution to mathematics. The (cid:12)rst of them is the Science Award of TU¨BI_TAK, in 466 KOC(cid:24) 1978. In1994,hewasawardedtheMustafaParlarHonoraryScienceAward,followedsoon after in1996bythe MeritAward givenbythe TU¨BI_TAK MarmaraResearch Center. He had been a member ofthe TU¨BI_TAK FundamentalSciences Group and onthe Advisory Board of the Turkish Journal of Mathematics for many years. He was elected to the Turkish Academy of Sciences in 1997. The pride of his distinctions must be the long list of his students; yet we are able to give only a small part of this list. No doubt, the actual list of formal or informal students who have profoundly bene(cid:12)ted from his suggestions and advice in their theses may be uncountable. His students include Timur Kara(cid:24)cay, Cemal Ko(cid:24)c, Birol Temelkuran, Arif Kaya, Nurettin Cengiz, Go¨nu¨l Uslu, Bekir K(cid:16)l(cid:16)(cid:24)co(cid:21)glu, Mahmut Hayfavi, Abdullah Harmanc(cid:16), Sadi Abou Saymeh, Ru¨stem Kaya, Ahmet Sharary, Abdurrahim Y(cid:16)lmaz, Fethi C(cid:24)all(cid:16)alp, Cesarettin Koc(cid:24), Mustafa Akgu¨l, I_brahim I_brahimog(cid:21)lu,Hasan I_lhan Tutalar, James Conlon. He was so kindhearted and benevolent that probably there was very few who met him that did not receive profound suggestions and advices to improve his/her work and ideas. In some gatherings, participants often urged him to talk on mathematics and mathematicians in general. I remember two such occurrences, one held in Alt(cid:16)noluk in a symposium organized by Bal(cid:16)kesir University, and the other at METU. They were full of panoramas of mathematics, wisdom re(cid:12)ned in his extensive experience and deep knowledge, witty jokes, and indispensable warnings and advice, always valid. Who can forget his voice at Alt(cid:16)noluk saying, \Avoid repeating yourselves in order to increase the number of publications only. Work out real problems of mathematics no matter how big they are"; or yet his unforgettable advice \When you worked on a problem for along time without any outcome, leave it alone for a wile and consider also some relatively small problems to keep up your courage and productivity." His memories of the di(cid:14)cult days of the Second World War in Japan may be a light of hope to every youngster in despair. He once recalled, \We were out of food, at the edge of starving, yet we were reading Pontriagin’s TopologicalGroups without skipping a word." Yet his suggestion and warning in [34] to young mathematicians about the works of Arf (now equally valid for his own works): \To my regret, however, Cahit Arf never had pupils (in a true sense) in Turkey; it might be because he is too great, or because his works are too hard for common mathematicians. In any case, it is a pity not for Cahit Arf but for Turkish Mathematics. I really do not see why Arf rings are studied by American 467 KOC(cid:24) mathematicians yet not by Turkish mathematicians, and why his wonderful thesis is intensively re-examined by German mathematiciansyet not by Turkish mathematicians. IamsurethatthegrowthofMathematicsinacountryis,ashistoryshows,onlypossibleif themathematiciansinthatcountrymathematicallyunderstandandstimulateeachother. So I should like to emphasize again that it is the task of young Turkish mathematicians work in these (cid:12)elds, (cid:12)rst to learn by heart what Cahit Arf did, and then to continue further study alongthe lines indicated by him." At the beginning of 2002, he began to dream again, of gathering young Istanbul researchers around a pursuit that mightmotivateand lead them to better collaboration. In this direction,beginningFebruary 2002,he organizedweekly seminars atthe Karak¨oy communication center of Sabanc(cid:16) University. He faithfullyattended these seminars until his illness came out in the summer of 2003. He delivered most of the lectures and supplemented and completed other lectures by his invaluable comments and remarks that we will always remember and sorely miss. 10 February 2003 might be said to be the QED at the end of his life, a life devoted to mathematics. Any word after this point would be superfluous, but it is adebt forme to express onbehalf ofmyself,his students, his colleagues and allthe mathematicians of the country, our praise, admiration,esteem and our deep gratitude to him.
