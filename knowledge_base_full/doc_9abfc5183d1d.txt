American Film Institute reveals recipients of 2022 AFI Awards Dec 12, 2022 The American Film Institute (AFI) has announced the recipients of AFI Awards 2022. AFI Awards honourees include 10 outstanding films and 10 outstanding TV programmes deemed culturally and artistically representative of this year’s most significant achievements in the art of the moving image. An additional honouree was selected for an AFI Special Award, designated for works of excellence that fall outside of AFI Awards’ eligibility criteria.

The event will be sponsored by FIJI Water. AFI Awards celebrates film and television arts’ collaborative nature and is the only national programme that honours creative teams as a whole, recognizing those in front of and behind the camera. All of the honoured works advance the art of the moving image, inspire audiences and artists alike and enhance the rich cultural heritage of America’s art form. When placed in a historical context, these stories provide a complex and rich visual record of our modern world. AFI Awards selections are made through a jury process where AFI Trustees, artists, critics and scholars determine the year’s most outstanding achievements and provide artistic and cultural context for the selection of each honouree. This year’s juries – one for film and one for television – featured acclaimed artists including W. Kamau Bell, Colman Domingo, Siân Heder, Brad Ingelsby, Marti Noxon, Mario Van Peebles; renowned film historians L.S. Kim, Akira Mizuta Lippit, Leonard Maltin and Robert Thompson; members of the AFI Board of Trustees; film critics Janet Maslin, Shawn Edwards from the African American Film Critics Association, and film and television critics from outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Salon, TV Guide and The Washington Post. The juries were chaired by AFI Board of Trustees member Jeanine Basinger (Chair Emerita and Founder of the Film Studies Department, Wesleyan University) and AFI Board of Trustees Vice Chair Richard Frank (former Chairman of Walt Disney Television, President of Walt Disney Studios, President of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences). The 2022 recipients join a distinguished group of previous AFI Awards honourees whose works define the art form and contribute to the US’ rich cultural legacy.

Kamau Bell, Colman Domingo, Siân Heder, Brad Ingelsby, Marti Noxon, Mario Van Peebles; renowned film historians L.S. Kim, Akira Mizuta Lippit, Leonard Maltin and Robert Thompson; members of the AFI Board of Trustees; film critics Janet Maslin, Shawn Edwards from the African American Film Critics Association, and film and television critics from outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, The New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Salon, TV Guide and The Washington Post. The juries were chaired by AFI Board of Trustees member Jeanine Basinger (Chair Emerita and Founder of the Film Studies Department, Wesleyan University) and AFI Board of Trustees Vice Chair Richard Frank (former Chairman of Walt Disney Television, President of Walt Disney Studios, President of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences).
