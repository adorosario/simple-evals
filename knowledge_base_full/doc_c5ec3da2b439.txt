Contents 1 Summary 2 Plot 3 Credits 4 Notes 5 Trivia 6 Quotes 7 Gallery 8 References Summary[] When a NASA representative visits Sheldon's school and dismisses his science, Sheldon is set on a mission to prove him wrong.[1] Plot[] Dr. Ronald Hodges, a NASA engineer, appears as a guest speaker in Sheldon's science class and does not take his idea about VTVL technology seriously, making Sheldon go to great lengths to prove him wrong. He tries to do the calculations himself, but he needs a computer to do so. When he realizes the family cannot afford one, he becomes frustrated, which causes him a stress ulcer. Sheldon takes the opportunity to use his doctor's computer and internet access to complete his calculations and send his results to NASA. When no reply comes, Sheldon gets depressed, prompting George to impulsively drive the family to the Johnson Space Center and demand that Hodges listen to Sheldon's idea. Hodges admits that it is theoretically valid, but that NASA lacks the technical capability to implement it at that time. Sheldon concludes that he is ahead of his time. On the way home, he thanks his father for standing up for him.
