(Photo by Santi Visalli/Getty Images)Getty ImagesIf one accepts the premise that the function of art is to evoke an involuntary emotional response, then it falls to reason that there are times and places when clothing (or costume) qualifies as art. Yet fashion, as an industry, is tainted with the sin of commerce. Perhaps the greatest proof of this can be found in what the Met Gala has become; the focus on a parade of celebrities in expensive costumes instead of the exhibition the fundraiser opens. Exhibitions, which the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute has historically planned to provoke conversation about the current state of the world. Looking at clothing in the context of societal events is much more interesting than what the celebration has become.Costume collections exist at prestigious institutions around the world, and there are many lauded museums that focus the scope of their collection on apparel or accessories. Obviously, not every garment made is art, and with the pathogen that is fast fashion overtaking increasingly growing portions of the global apparel market, oftentimes what we wear could not even rightly be called craft.

(Photo by Charles/New York Times Co./Getty Images)Getty ImagesApparel is mostly intended, thought of, and produced for its utility. Clothing is, after all, well-known to be only a physiological need, lumped in with rather plebeian company, at the very base of Maslow’s famous hierarchy. The balance of these attitudes has created a fascinating intersection where art, or the potential for art, collides with the billions of dollars relegated to the buying and selling of clothing, which make up the less glamorous reality of the fashion industry. These systemic machinations make for a dance that is very traditionally American and has regularly been very publicly exorcized in a ritual procession on the First Monday each May. The Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit, which we have all collectively renamed “the Met Gala,” is at its heart a fundraiser. A very successful one. The philanthropic event, staged with great attention paid to pomp and circumstance, voraciously solicits donations from wealthy sources. This is money that the Costume Institute very much needs, and it is a well-known fact that among the various bodies that make up New York City’s most famous museum, the Costume Institute is the only department responsible for producing the funding it requires, including the costs of day to day operations.Play Puzzles & Games on ForbesFEATURED | Frase ByForbes™Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The PhrasePlay NowPinpoint By LinkedinGuess The CategoryPlay NowQueens By LinkedinCrown Each RegionPlay NowCrossclimb By LinkedinUnlock A Trivia LadderPlay NowJackie Onassis during Costume Institute Gala Presents "Fashions of The Hapsburg Era" at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, United States.

The original “midnight suppers” were held in December, not May, perhaps in conjunction with the fundraising goal, as the last month of the calendar year is the last chance to transform profits into donations, a conversion that can have an effect on an entity’s tax burden, which the American’s with the greatest number of resources have made their own art form out of reducing.The Met Gala has been an exercise in contemplating the state of fashion in the world since the 1970s, when Diana Vreeland joined the Met’s Costume Institute as a Special Consultant. The bones of the event are much older, dating back to 1948, when the newly formed curatorial department appealed for donations from the sort of soft-spots possessed by old school, traditional New York society types. The decision to turn the quiet yearly fundraiser into a star studded event, dense with celebrities and the attention they bring with them, can be credited to Vreeland.

(Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesBetween 1936 and 1971, Diana Vreeland worked in fashion publishing, first ascending the ranks at Harper’s Bazaar. There is some murkiness about her leaving the publication, which experienced a regime change following the retirement of its revolutionary editrix-in-chief Carmel Snow, who was editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958.Without hyperbole, it is fair to say that Snow’s work solidified and consecrated the very concept of The American Look, which is a mid-20th-century era when the United States first began to emerge as its own source of style, differentiated and distinct in its adherence (or lack thereof) to the dictums presented on by runways in Paris. Carmel Snow is the person who, after seeing Christian Dior’s (inaugural) Spring/Summer haute couture collection in 1947, supposedly said, “it’s such a New Look,” words we still use to describe the post-war shift that dramatically changed what women wore in the western world.NEW YORK, NY- DEC 12: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Carl Katz (left) attends the Diana Vreeland opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on December 12, 1977 in New York City. (Photo by PL Gould/IMAGES/Getty Images)Getty ImagesWorld War II became real to much of the world months after it was officially declared. When May of 1940 ended it became obvious that for the foreseeable future, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world. Carmel Snow, and her competition, Edna Woolman Chase over at Vogue, decided the easiest solution, and the most profitable, was to remake fashion as an industry through the lens of their nation, which is known to measure value in the number of dollars profited.During her time under Snow at Harper’s, Vreeland, who started off with a bafflingly out-of-touch advice column during the early years of the Great Depression, worked her way up and became the magazine’s fashion editor. The list of significant accomplishments Vreeland achieved while working at the magazine is too long to try and summarize. Two examples, both of which had global ramifications, were her discovery of Lauren Bacall, who she cast as a model (and then directed) for a very famous March, 1943 cover-shoot by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, another mid century luminary and tastemaker in the stable of talented individuals Snow mentored over the course of her enviable career.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesVreeland was also responsible for the magazine publication of the first photograph of a woman wearing a bikini. In 1945, while on vacation on the French Riviera, Vreeland saw European women wearing two piece swimsuits, as though such a thing was normal, even though Jacques Heim or Louis Reard (it’s a long story) had only recently invented the style of swimwear, which got its name from an atoll near Guam that had been used as a nuclear testing site. Back in New York, Vreeland convinced Carolyn Schurner, one of the many successful (and mostly female) designers responsible for the American Look, to recreate a bikini out of mallinson rayon. Toni Frissell, a female photographer who was nurtured by Snow’s all-seeing-eye, shot an iconic image of supermodel Dovima wearing the green and white swimsuit, in repose on a white platform in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Vreeland was born Diana Daizel, to a Scottish father and an American mother, in Paris in 1903, to a family whose ancestors include both Martha Washington and Francis Scott Key. When World War I loomed on the horizon in 1914, they relocated to the United States, eventually settling in New York City. She never finished traditional schooling, and spent what we would now think of as her high school years at a ballet school. She married Thomas Reed Vreeland, who was training to be a banker, on March 1, 1924. The couple moved to London just before the market crash in 1929, where Mr. Vreeland, who went by his middle name, had secured a position with a trust.Cher during Diana Vreeland's 14th Annual Costume Exhibit at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, United States. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesIn London, Vreeland was mostly a socialite-slash-housewife, a mother to two young boys, with the distinction of running her own small lingerie business. That venture is connected to a famous story that apparently Vreeland herself said to be true. That Woman, as Wallis Simpson was snobbily referred to by the unforgiving British press, purchased the nightgown she wore during her first weekend away with Edward, Prince of Wales, from Diana Vreeland. In a wonderful biography written by the incomparable Amy Fine Collins for Vanity Fair in 2011, Vreeland’s son Frecky (Frederick Vreeland) explains that the story became a well-worn family tale, that time when “mom’s store brought down the British empire.”In 1936 the family returned to New York, and in another bit of fashion lore, Vreeland was spotted by Carmel Snow, editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958. Ms. Snow has her own fascinating story, which I will regale you with another time, but for know, suffice it to say she blew off Conde Nast to take the job at Harper’s and quickly began rearranging the practices and procedures that link editorial work and advertising, and in doing so introduced to the world a bevy of talents. The story is that when the figurative duchess of the American fashion Magazine, Carmel Snow, first saw Vreeland, she was dancing. Wearing a white lace Chanel dress and bolero, with white roses in her hair, the younger woman was attending a party on the roof of the Saint Regis, a luxury hotel in Manhattan. The next morning Snow called Vreeland and offered her a job at the magazine. Diana apparently protested on the grounds of inexperience, but was convinced, and joined a set of artists, writers, photographers and designers whose work illustrated generations of Americans.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesWhen the dust settled in America's fashion publication community after Carmel Snow retired, Vreeland was at Vogue, a change which is likely related to the merger salary the Hearst Corporation had been compensating her with, combined with the perceived disrespect in being passed over in the process of selecting new leadership. Vreeland was made Vogue’s editor-in-chief in 1963, about a year after she joined the masthead for the magazine. she encouraged Rudi Gernreich, discovered Edie Sedgewick, and generally worked to amplify the youthquake which was soon erupting in major cities beyond London, ricocheting, sort of, around the world. Eventually it would change everything, all over again. These were good years for Vreeland, who ruled like a truly benevolent dictator, enforcing a veritable renaissance of creativity and design, which turns out to be an especially expensive way to produce a publication. And spending is probably why Condé Nast eventually, and unceremoniously, fired Vreeland in 1971. Money management was never her strongest suit, and the same sort of problems persisted in her private life.

(Photo by Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)Getty ImagesPerhaps some of Vreeland’s mystique is related to the lack of exact details, the documentable sort, about major events in her life and career, and the quantity and quality of stories that differ in their telling, regaling those same moments from so many points of view. It is possible, maybe likely, that some of Diana Vreeland’s friends softened her descent from Conde Nast by providing her with employment as a Special Consultant to the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute. Jackie Onassis and Babe Paley are among the names tossed around when anyone tries to explain how her position was funded at a museum operating at a dangerous deficit, a series of financial years which would continue to decline until it approached $100,000 in 1974, according to The New York Times.Such meetings, not quite clandestine, benefited greatly from the limits to technology which existed at the beginning of the last quarter of the 20th century. The same could be said about the interaction of the Met Gala, as it grew, to the events of the world that occurred as each year slipped by with an intensity that increased in proportion to our ability to document and exploit the events that shape global culture. The ability to focus a lens and to share a story has accelerated beyond reason, nearly to the point of over exposure in 2024. But the days are long and weeks are short, and looking back now at the last 16 years of Diana Vreeland’s life, which are the same year’s when she ruled over the Gala, it is possible to see a significant transition.

(Photo by New York Times Co./Getty Images)Getty ImagesIf you look into the global events of any year between 1973 and 1989, you will see their reflection in the exhibition opened by this infamous party. Exhibitions are not simple to arrange. The work that goes into them requires months of research, staging, scheduling and a crucial-but-often-tentative arrangement of agreements about objects being borrowed whose provenance has legal and insurance related ramifications. Jackie-O already had quite the CV related to the intersection of government (mostly as related to funding) and the international museum community, and her interest in fashion and style brought a lot more of both to Washington than the city was used to.The first Ambassador to receive an audience with President Kennedy was French, Hervé Alphand, whose fabulous second wife Nicole quickly set to work impressing the First Lady with the many marvels of French culture that only she could produce. She brought Marc Bohan, of Christian Dior, to her D.C. Embassy home in 1961, with models, to hold a private fashion show over tea. Pierre Cardin similarly visited in 1963, the same year that the machinations of the two ladies resulted in the only time that Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa traveled to the United States, for an exhibition which opened on January 9, 1963.

(Photo by Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)Getty ImagesOf course, Jackie’s position of support, as formalized in its presentation by her first husband, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also resulted in the congressional allocation of funding that was donated to preserve the 10th-century Temple of Dendur from the floodwaters which would have forever submerged it following the completion of the Aswan Dam of the Nile in Egypt. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, sponsored the efforts to re-home the temple, which had been erected during the reign of Augustus Caesar, asking global powers with deep pockets to chip in on behalf of humanity’s collective history. The actual Temple was gifted, in a pretty obvious pairing of call-and-response, to the United States, probably as a “thank you” for the country's $10 million dollar contribution. This gift caused a rift between the Smithsonian Museum, in Washington, D.C., who wanted to add the massive structure to its collections, and the Metropolitan Museum, who actually did, after Lyndon Johnson’s administration inherited the task of choosing which lauded institution would receive it. Considering all of this, how much of a leap might it be to wonder what the intentions were, when Jackie and Diane planned the party celebrating the 1976 Met Gala, the year of America’s Bicentennial, and opened an exhibition called The Glory of Russian Costume at the height of the Cold War. Vreeland’s first official gala, on March 21, 1973, was The World of Balenciaga, ostensibly only a show about the Basque couturier who had died a year earlier, but which was officially sponsored by the government of Spain, as that country and ours worked to broker better relations after decades of strife. In 1975, the 200 year anniversary of the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Met celebrated American Women of Style. In 1980, a year when America was quite publicly working to normalize relations in Asia, the museum staged The Manchu Dragon: Costumes of China.

But the big things don’t really ever seem to change. Good stuff or bad. And fashion can still be art, costume can as well. But without either, it is still possible to use clothing as a way to explain or discuss our past, or even the events of the world as they unfold. What is real has always been more intriguing to us than fiction. Surely there is a way to plan a party, even one that has so much depending upon the amount of money raised, that gives weight to the most important part of this event: the actual exhibition. Wouldn’t it be more interesting to focus on that?Editorial StandardsReprints & PermissionsLOADING VIDEO PLAYER.FORBES’ FEATURED Video ShareSaveCommentAdd Us On GoogleNEW YORK, NY - JULY 20: Diana Vreeland posing for a photo on July 20, 1982 in New York, New York.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, sponsored the efforts to re-home the temple, which had been erected during the reign of Augustus Caesar, asking global powers with deep pockets to chip in on behalf of humanity’s collective history. The actual Temple was gifted, in a pretty obvious pairing of call-and-response, to the United States, probably as a “thank you” for the country's $10 million dollar contribution. This gift caused a rift between the Smithsonian Museum, in Washington, D.C., who wanted to add the massive structure to its collections, and the Metropolitan Museum, who actually did, after Lyndon Johnson’s administration inherited the task of choosing which lauded institution would receive it. Considering all of this, how much of a leap might it be to wonder what the intentions were, when Jackie and Diane planned the party celebrating the 1976 Met Gala, the year of America’s Bicentennial, and opened an exhibition called The Glory of Russian Costume at the height of the Cold War. Vreeland’s first official gala, on March 21, 1973, was The World of Balenciaga, ostensibly only a show about the Basque couturier who had died a year earlier, but which was officially sponsored by the government of Spain, as that country and ours worked to broker better relations after decades of strife. In 1975, the 200 year anniversary of the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Met celebrated American Women of Style. In 1980, a year when America was quite publicly working to normalize relations in Asia, the museum staged The Manchu Dragon: Costumes of China.

There is some murkiness about her leaving the publication, which experienced a regime change following the retirement of its revolutionary editrix-in-chief Carmel Snow, who was editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958.Without hyperbole, it is fair to say that Snow’s work solidified and consecrated the very concept of The American Look, which is a mid-20th-century era when the United States first began to emerge as its own source of style, differentiated and distinct in its adherence (or lack thereof) to the dictums presented on by runways in Paris. Carmel Snow is the person who, after seeing Christian Dior’s (inaugural) Spring/Summer haute couture collection in 1947, supposedly said, “it’s such a New Look,” words we still use to describe the post-war shift that dramatically changed what women wore in the western world.NEW YORK, NY- DEC 12: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Carl Katz (left) attends the Diana Vreeland opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on December 12, 1977 in New York City.

When May of 1940 ended it became obvious that for the foreseeable future, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world. Carmel Snow, and her competition, Edna Woolman Chase over at Vogue, decided the easiest solution, and the most profitable, was to remake fashion as an industry through the lens of their nation, which is known to measure value in the number of dollars profited.During her time under Snow at Harper’s, Vreeland, who started off with a bafflingly out-of-touch advice column during the early years of the Great Depression, worked her way up and became the magazine’s fashion editor. The list of significant accomplishments Vreeland achieved while working at the magazine is too long to try and summarize. Two examples, both of which had global ramifications, were her discovery of Lauren Bacall, who she cast as a model (and then directed) for a very famous March, 1943 cover-shoot by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, another mid century luminary and tastemaker in the stable of talented individuals Snow mentored over the course of her enviable career.

In 1945, while on vacation on the French Riviera, Vreeland saw European women wearing two piece swimsuits, as though such a thing was normal, even though Jacques Heim or Louis Reard (it’s a long story) had only recently invented the style of swimwear, which got its name from an atoll near Guam that had been used as a nuclear testing site. Back in New York, Vreeland convinced Carolyn Schurner, one of the many successful (and mostly female) designers responsible for the American Look, to recreate a bikini out of mallinson rayon. Toni Frissell, a female photographer who was nurtured by Snow’s all-seeing-eye, shot an iconic image of supermodel Dovima wearing the green and white swimsuit, in repose on a white platform in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Vreeland was born Diana Daizel, to a Scottish father and an American mother, in Paris in 1903, to a family whose ancestors include both Martha Washington and Francis Scott Key. When World War I loomed on the horizon in 1914, they relocated to the United States, eventually settling in New York City. She never finished traditional schooling, and spent what we would now think of as her high school years at a ballet school. She married Thomas Reed Vreeland, who was training to be a banker, on March 1, 1924. The couple moved to London just before the market crash in 1929, where Mr. Vreeland, who went by his middle name, had secured a position with a trust.Cher during Diana Vreeland's 14th Annual Costume Exhibit at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, United States. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesIn London, Vreeland was mostly a socialite-slash-housewife, a mother to two young boys, with the distinction of running her own small lingerie business. That venture is connected to a famous story that apparently Vreeland herself said to be true. That Woman, as Wallis Simpson was snobbily referred to by the unforgiving British press, purchased the nightgown she wore during her first weekend away with Edward, Prince of Wales, from Diana Vreeland. In a wonderful biography written by the incomparable Amy Fine Collins for Vanity Fair in 2011, Vreeland’s son Frecky (Frederick Vreeland) explains that the story became a well-worn family tale, that time when “mom’s store brought down the British empire.”In 1936 the family returned to New York, and in another bit of fashion lore, Vreeland was spotted by Carmel Snow, editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958. Ms. Snow has her own fascinating story, which I will regale you with another time, but for know, suffice it to say she blew off Conde Nast to take the job at Harper’s and quickly began rearranging the practices and procedures that link editorial work and advertising, and in doing so introduced to the world a bevy of talents. The story is that when the figurative duchess of the American fashion Magazine, Carmel Snow, first saw Vreeland, she was dancing. Wearing a white lace Chanel dress and bolero, with white roses in her hair, the younger woman was attending a party on the roof of the Saint Regis, a luxury hotel in Manhattan. The next morning Snow called Vreeland and offered her a job at the magazine. Diana apparently protested on the grounds of inexperience, but was convinced, and joined a set of artists, writers, photographers and designers whose work illustrated generations of Americans.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesWhen the dust settled in America's fashion publication community after Carmel Snow retired, Vreeland was at Vogue, a change which is likely related to the merger salary the Hearst Corporation had been compensating her with, combined with the perceived disrespect in being passed over in the process of selecting new leadership. Vreeland was made Vogue’s editor-in-chief in 1963, about a year after she joined the masthead for the magazine. she encouraged Rudi Gernreich, discovered Edie Sedgewick, and generally worked to amplify the youthquake which was soon erupting in major cities beyond London, ricocheting, sort of, around the world. Eventually it would change everything, all over again. These were good years for Vreeland, who ruled like a truly benevolent dictator, enforcing a veritable renaissance of creativity and design, which turns out to be an especially expensive way to produce a publication. And spending is probably why Condé Nast eventually, and unceremoniously, fired Vreeland in 1971. Money management was never her strongest suit, and the same sort of problems persisted in her private life.

(Photo by Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)Getty ImagesPerhaps some of Vreeland’s mystique is related to the lack of exact details, the documentable sort, about major events in her life and career, and the quantity and quality of stories that differ in their telling, regaling those same moments from so many points of view. It is possible, maybe likely, that some of Diana Vreeland’s friends softened her descent from Conde Nast by providing her with employment as a Special Consultant to the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute. Jackie Onassis and Babe Paley are among the names tossed around when anyone tries to explain how her position was funded at a museum operating at a dangerous deficit, a series of financial years which would continue to decline until it approached $100,000 in 1974, according to The New York Times.Such meetings, not quite clandestine, benefited greatly from the limits to technology which existed at the beginning of the last quarter of the 20th century. The same could be said about the interaction of the Met Gala, as it grew, to the events of the world that occurred as each year slipped by with an intensity that increased in proportion to our ability to document and exploit the events that shape global culture. The ability to focus a lens and to share a story has accelerated beyond reason, nearly to the point of over exposure in 2024. But the days are long and weeks are short, and looking back now at the last 16 years of Diana Vreeland’s life, which are the same year’s when she ruled over the Gala, it is possible to see a significant transition.

Exhibitions are not simple to arrange. The work that goes into them requires months of research, staging, scheduling and a crucial-but-often-tentative arrangement of agreements about objects being borrowed whose provenance has legal and insurance related ramifications.

(Photo by Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)Getty ImagesPerhaps some of Vreeland’s mystique is related to the lack of exact details, the documentable sort, about major events in her life and career, and the quantity and quality of stories that differ in their telling, regaling those same moments from so many points of view. It is possible, maybe likely, that some of Diana Vreeland’s friends softened her descent from Conde Nast by providing her with employment as a Special Consultant to the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute. Jackie Onassis and Babe Paley are among the names tossed around when anyone tries to explain how her position was funded at a museum operating at a dangerous deficit, a series of financial years which would continue to decline until it approached $100,000 in 1974, according to The New York Times.Such meetings, not quite clandestine, benefited greatly from the limits to technology which existed at the beginning of the last quarter of the 20th century. The same could be said about the interaction of the Met Gala, as it grew, to the events of the world that occurred as each year slipped by with an intensity that increased in proportion to our ability to document and exploit the events that shape global culture. The ability to focus a lens and to share a story has accelerated beyond reason, nearly to the point of over exposure in 2024. But the days are long and weeks are short, and looking back now at the last 16 years of Diana Vreeland’s life, which are the same year’s when she ruled over the Gala, it is possible to see a significant transition.

Exhibitions are not simple to arrange. The work that goes into them requires months of research, staging, scheduling and a crucial-but-often-tentative arrangement of agreements about objects being borrowed whose provenance has legal and insurance related ramifications. Jackie-O already had quite the CV related to the intersection of government (mostly as related to funding) and the international museum community, and her interest in fashion and style brought a lot more of both to Washington than the city was used to.The first Ambassador to receive an audience with President Kennedy was French, Hervé Alphand, whose fabulous second wife Nicole quickly set to work impressing the First Lady with the many marvels of French culture that only she could produce. She brought Marc Bohan, of Christian Dior, to her D.C. Embassy home in 1961, with models, to hold a private fashion show over tea. Pierre Cardin similarly visited in 1963, the same year that the machinations of the two ladies resulted in the only time that Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa traveled to the United States, for an exhibition which opened on January 9, 1963.

(Photo by Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images)Getty ImagesOf course, Jackie’s position of support, as formalized in its presentation by her first husband, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, also resulted in the congressional allocation of funding that was donated to preserve the 10th-century Temple of Dendur from the floodwaters which would have forever submerged it following the completion of the Aswan Dam of the Nile in Egypt. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, sponsored the efforts to re-home the temple, which had been erected during the reign of Augustus Caesar, asking global powers with deep pockets to chip in on behalf of humanity’s collective history. The actual Temple was gifted, in a pretty obvious pairing of call-and-response, to the United States, probably as a “thank you” for the country's $10 million dollar contribution. This gift caused a rift between the Smithsonian Museum, in Washington, D.C., who wanted to add the massive structure to its collections, and the Metropolitan Museum, who actually did, after Lyndon Johnson’s administration inherited the task of choosing which lauded institution would receive it. Considering all of this, how much of a leap might it be to wonder what the intentions were, when Jackie and Diane planned the party celebrating the 1976 Met Gala, the year of America’s Bicentennial, and opened an exhibition called The Glory of Russian Costume at the height of the Cold War. Vreeland’s first official gala, on March 21, 1973, was The World of Balenciaga, ostensibly only a show about the Basque couturier who had died a year earlier, but which was officially sponsored by the government of Spain, as that country and ours worked to broker better relations after decades of strife. In 1975, the 200 year anniversary of the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Met celebrated American Women of Style. In 1980, a year when America was quite publicly working to normalize relations in Asia, the museum staged The Manchu Dragon: Costumes of China.

There is some murkiness about her leaving the publication, which experienced a regime change following the retirement of its revolutionary editrix-in-chief Carmel Snow, who was editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958.Without hyperbole, it is fair to say that Snow’s work solidified and consecrated the very concept of The American Look, which is a mid-20th-century era when the United States first began to emerge as its own source of style, differentiated and distinct in its adherence (or lack thereof) to the dictums presented on by runways in Paris. Carmel Snow is the person who, after seeing Christian Dior’s (inaugural) Spring/Summer haute couture collection in 1947, supposedly said, “it’s such a New Look,” words we still use to describe the post-war shift that dramatically changed what women wore in the western world.NEW YORK, NY- DEC 12: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Carl Katz (left) attends the Diana Vreeland opening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on December 12, 1977 in New York City.

When May of 1940 ended it became obvious that for the foreseeable future, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world. Carmel Snow, and her competition, Edna Woolman Chase over at Vogue, decided the easiest solution, and the most profitable, was to remake fashion as an industry through the lens of their nation, which is known to measure value in the number of dollars profited.During her time under Snow at Harper’s, Vreeland, who started off with a bafflingly out-of-touch advice column during the early years of the Great Depression, worked her way up and became the magazine’s fashion editor. The list of significant accomplishments Vreeland achieved while working at the magazine is too long to try and summarize. Two examples, both of which had global ramifications, were her discovery of Lauren Bacall, who she cast as a model (and then directed) for a very famous March, 1943 cover-shoot by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, another mid century luminary and tastemaker in the stable of talented individuals Snow mentored over the course of her enviable career.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesVreeland was also responsible for the magazine publication of the first photograph of a woman wearing a bikini. In 1945, while on vacation on the French Riviera, Vreeland saw European women wearing two piece swimsuits, as though such a thing was normal, even though Jacques Heim or Louis Reard (it’s a long story) had only recently invented the style of swimwear, which got its name from an atoll near Guam that had been used as a nuclear testing site. Back in New York, Vreeland convinced Carolyn Schurner, one of the many successful (and mostly female) designers responsible for the American Look, to recreate a bikini out of mallinson rayon. Toni Frissell, a female photographer who was nurtured by Snow’s all-seeing-eye, shot an iconic image of supermodel Dovima wearing the green and white swimsuit, in repose on a white platform in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Vreeland was born Diana Daizel, to a Scottish father and an American mother, in Paris in 1903, to a family whose ancestors include both Martha Washington and Francis Scott Key. When World War I loomed on the horizon in 1914, they relocated to the United States, eventually settling in New York City. She never finished traditional schooling, and spent what we would now think of as her high school years at a ballet school. She married Thomas Reed Vreeland, who was training to be a banker, on March 1, 1924. The couple moved to London just before the market crash in 1929, where Mr. Vreeland, who went by his middle name, had secured a position with a trust.Cher during Diana Vreeland's 14th Annual Costume Exhibit at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, New York, United States. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)Ron Galella Collection via Getty ImagesIn London, Vreeland was mostly a socialite-slash-housewife, a mother to two young boys, with the distinction of running her own small lingerie business. That venture is connected to a famous story that apparently Vreeland herself said to be true. That Woman, as Wallis Simpson was snobbily referred to by the unforgiving British press, purchased the nightgown she wore during her first weekend away with Edward, Prince of Wales, from Diana Vreeland. In a wonderful biography written by the incomparable Amy Fine Collins for Vanity Fair in 2011, Vreeland’s son Frecky (Frederick Vreeland) explains that the story became a well-worn family tale, that time when “mom’s store brought down the British empire.”In 1936 the family returned to New York, and in another bit of fashion lore, Vreeland was spotted by Carmel Snow, editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958. Ms. Snow has her own fascinating story, which I will regale you with another time, but for know, suffice it to say she blew off Conde Nast to take the job at Harper’s and quickly began rearranging the practices and procedures that link editorial work and advertising, and in doing so introduced to the world a bevy of talents. The story is that when the figurative duchess of the American fashion Magazine, Carmel Snow, first saw Vreeland, she was dancing. Wearing a white lace Chanel dress and bolero, with white roses in her hair, the younger woman was attending a party on the roof of the Saint Regis, a luxury hotel in Manhattan. The next morning Snow called Vreeland and offered her a job at the magazine. Diana apparently protested on the grounds of inexperience, but was convinced, and joined a set of artists, writers, photographers and designers whose work illustrated generations of Americans.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesWhen the dust settled in America's fashion publication community after Carmel Snow retired, Vreeland was at Vogue, a change which is likely related to the merger salary the Hearst Corporation had been compensating her with, combined with the perceived disrespect in being passed over in the process of selecting new leadership. Vreeland was made Vogue’s editor-in-chief in 1963, about a year after she joined the masthead for the magazine. she encouraged Rudi Gernreich, discovered Edie Sedgewick, and generally worked to amplify the youthquake which was soon erupting in major cities beyond London, ricocheting, sort of, around the world. Eventually it would change everything, all over again. These were good years for Vreeland, who ruled like a truly benevolent dictator, enforcing a veritable renaissance of creativity and design, which turns out to be an especially expensive way to produce a publication. And spending is probably why Condé Nast eventually, and unceremoniously, fired Vreeland in 1971. Money management was never her strongest suit, and the same sort of problems persisted in her private life.

Ms. Snow has her own fascinating story, which I will regale you with another time, but for know, suffice it to say she blew off Conde Nast to take the job at Harper’s and quickly began rearranging the practices and procedures that link editorial work and advertising, and in doing so introduced to the world a bevy of talents. The story is that when the figurative duchess of the American fashion Magazine, Carmel Snow, first saw Vreeland, she was dancing. Wearing a white lace Chanel dress and bolero, with white roses in her hair, the younger woman was attending a party on the roof of the Saint Regis, a luxury hotel in Manhattan. The next morning Snow called Vreeland and offered her a job at the magazine. Diana apparently protested on the grounds of inexperience, but was convinced, and joined a set of artists, writers, photographers and designers whose work illustrated generations of Americans.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images)Penske Media via Getty ImagesWhen the dust settled in America's fashion publication community after Carmel Snow retired, Vreeland was at Vogue, a change which is likely related to the merger salary the Hearst Corporation had been compensating her with, combined with the perceived disrespect in being passed over in the process of selecting new leadership. Vreeland was made Vogue’s editor-in-chief in 1963, about a year after she joined the masthead for the magazine. she encouraged Rudi Gernreich, discovered Edie Sedgewick, and generally worked to amplify the youthquake which was soon erupting in major cities beyond London, ricocheting, sort of, around the world. Eventually it would change everything, all over again. These were good years for Vreeland, who ruled like a truly benevolent dictator, enforcing a veritable renaissance of creativity and design, which turns out to be an especially expensive way to produce a publication. And spending is probably why Condé Nast eventually, and unceremoniously, fired Vreeland in 1971. Money management was never her strongest suit, and the same sort of problems persisted in her private life.

It is possible, maybe likely, that some of Diana Vreeland’s friends softened her descent from Conde Nast by providing her with employment as a Special Consultant to the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute. Jackie Onassis and Babe Paley are among the names tossed around when anyone tries to explain how her position was funded at a museum operating at a dangerous deficit, a series of financial years which would continue to decline until it approached $100,000 in 1974, according to The New York Times.Such meetings, not quite clandestine, benefited greatly from the limits to technology which existed at the beginning of the last quarter of the 20th century. The same could be said about the interaction of the Met Gala, as it grew, to the events of the world that occurred as each year slipped by with an intensity that increased in proportion to our ability to document and exploit the events that shape global culture. The ability to focus a lens and to share a story has accelerated beyond reason, nearly to the point of over exposure in 2024. But the days are long and weeks are short, and looking back now at the last 16 years of Diana Vreeland’s life, which are the same year’s when she ruled over the Gala, it is possible to see a significant transition.

Exhibitions are not simple to arrange. The work that goes into them requires months of research, staging, scheduling and a crucial-but-often-tentative arrangement of agreements about objects being borrowed whose provenance has legal and insurance related ramifications. Jackie-O already had quite the CV related to the intersection of government (mostly as related to funding) and the international museum community, and her interest in fashion and style brought a lot more of both to Washington than the city was used to.The first Ambassador to receive an audience with President Kennedy was French, Hervé Alphand, whose fabulous second wife Nicole quickly set to work impressing the First Lady with the many marvels of French culture that only she could produce. She brought Marc Bohan, of Christian Dior, to her D.C. Embassy home in 1961, with models, to hold a private fashion show over tea.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, sponsored the efforts to re-home the temple, which had been erected during the reign of Augustus Caesar, asking global powers with deep pockets to chip in on behalf of humanity’s collective history. The actual Temple was gifted, in a pretty obvious pairing of call-and-response, to the United States, probably as a “thank you” for the country's $10 million dollar contribution. This gift caused a rift between the Smithsonian Museum, in Washington, D.C., who wanted to add the massive structure to its collections, and the Metropolitan Museum, who actually did, after Lyndon Johnson’s administration inherited the task of choosing which lauded institution would receive it. Considering all of this, how much of a leap might it be to wonder what the intentions were, when Jackie and Diane planned the party celebrating the 1976 Met Gala, the year of America’s Bicentennial, and opened an exhibition called The Glory of Russian Costume at the height of the Cold War. Vreeland’s first official gala, on March 21, 1973, was The World of Balenciaga, ostensibly only a show about the Basque couturier who had died a year earlier, but which was officially sponsored by the government of Spain, as that country and ours worked to broker better relations after decades of strife. In 1975, the 200 year anniversary of the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Met celebrated American Women of Style. In 1980, a year when America was quite publicly working to normalize relations in Asia, the museum staged The Manchu Dragon: Costumes of China.

But the big things don’t really ever seem to change. Good stuff or bad. And fashion can still be art, costume can as well. But without either, it is still possible to use clothing as a way to explain or discuss our past, or even the events of the world as they unfold. What is real has always been more intriguing to us than fiction. Surely there is a way to plan a party, even one that has so much depending upon the amount of money raised, that gives weight to the most important part of this event: the actual exhibition. Wouldn’t it be more interesting to focus on that? NEW YORK, NY - JULY 20: Diana Vreeland posing for a photo on July 20, 1982 in New York, New York.

(Photo by Santi Visalli/Getty Images) If one accepts the premise that the function of art is to evoke an involuntary emotional response, then it falls to reason that there are times and places when clothing (or costume) qualifies as art. Yet fashion, as an industry, is tainted with the sin of commerce. Perhaps the greatest proof of this can be found in what the Met Gala has become; the focus on a parade of celebrities in expensive costumes instead of the exhibition the fundraiser opens. Exhibitions, which the Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute has historically planned to provoke conversation about the current state of the world. Looking at clothing in the context of societal events is much more interesting than what the celebration has become. Costume collections exist at prestigious institutions around the world, and there are many lauded museums that focus the scope of their collection on apparel or accessories. Obviously, not every garment made is art, and with the pathogen that is fast fashion overtaking increasingly growing portions of the global apparel market, oftentimes what we wear could not even rightly be called craft.

(Photo by Charles/New York Times Co./Getty Images) Apparel is mostly intended, thought of, and produced for its utility. Clothing is, after all, well-known to be only a physiological need, lumped in with rather plebeian company, at the very base of Maslow’s famous hierarchy. The balance of these attitudes has created a fascinating intersection where art, or the potential for art, collides with the billions of dollars relegated to the buying and selling of clothing, which make up the less glamorous reality of the fashion industry. These systemic machinations make for a dance that is very traditionally American and has regularly been very publicly exorcized in a ritual procession on the First Monday each May. The Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute Benefit, which we have all collectively renamed “the Met Gala,” is at its heart a fundraiser. A very successful one. The philanthropic event, staged with great attention paid to pomp and circumstance, voraciously solicits donations from wealthy sources. This is money that the Costume Institute very much needs, and it is a well-known fact that among the various bodies that make up New York City’s most famous museum, the Costume Institute is the only department responsible for producing the funding it requires, including the costs of day to day operations.

(Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) Looking back, considering the span of decades that is the history of this specific party, one can quickly come to the conclusion that decadence and spectacle we cannot help but witness each year had a much more subtle beginning. The original “midnight suppers” were held in December, not May, perhaps in conjunction with the fundraising goal, as the last month of the calendar year is the last chance to transform profits into donations, a conversion that can have an effect on an entity’s tax burden, which the American’s with the greatest number of resources have made their own art form out of reducing. The Met Gala has been an exercise in contemplating the state of fashion in the world since the 1970s, when Diana Vreeland joined the Met’s Costume Institute as a Special Consultant. The bones of the event are much older, dating back to 1948, when the newly formed curatorial department appealed for donations from the sort of soft-spots possessed by old school, traditional New York society types. The decision to turn the quiet yearly fundraiser into a star studded event, dense with celebrities and the attention they bring with them, can be credited to Vreeland.

(Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) Between 1936 and 1971, Diana Vreeland worked in fashion publishing, first ascending the ranks at Harper’s Bazaar. There is some murkiness about her leaving the publication, which experienced a regime change following the retirement of its revolutionary editrix-in-chief Carmel Snow, who was editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958. Without hyperbole, it is fair to say that Snow’s work solidified and consecrated the very concept of The American Look, which is a mid-20th-century era when the United States first began to emerge as its own source of style, differentiated and distinct in its adherence (or lack thereof) to the dictums presented on by runways in Paris. Carmel Snow is the person who, after seeing Christian Dior’s (inaugural) Spring/Summer haute couture collection in 1947, supposedly said, “it’s such a New Look,” words we still use to describe the post-war shift that dramatically changed what women wore in the western world.

(Photo by PL Gould/IMAGES/Getty Images) World War II became real to much of the world months after it was officially declared. When May of 1940 ended it became obvious that for the foreseeable future, Paris would be cut off from the rest of the world. Carmel Snow, and her competition, Edna Woolman Chase over at Vogue, decided the easiest solution, and the most profitable, was to remake fashion as an industry through the lens of their nation, which is known to measure value in the number of dollars profited. During her time under Snow at Harper’s, Vreeland, who started off with a bafflingly out-of-touch advice column during the early years of the Great Depression, worked her way up and became the magazine’s fashion editor. The list of significant accomplishments Vreeland achieved while working at the magazine is too long to try and summarize. Two examples, both of which had global ramifications, were her discovery of Lauren Bacall, who she cast as a model (and then directed) for a very famous March, 1943 cover-shoot by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, another mid century luminary and tastemaker in the stable of talented individuals Snow mentored over the course of her enviable career.

(Photo by Fairchild Archive/WWD/Penske Media via Getty Images) Vreeland was also responsible for the magazine publication of the first photograph of a woman wearing a bikini. In 1945, while on vacation on the French Riviera, Vreeland saw European women wearing two piece swimsuits, as though such a thing was normal, even though Jacques Heim or Louis Reard (it’s a long story) had only recently invented the style of swimwear, which got its name from an atoll near Guam that had been used as a nuclear testing site. Back in New York, Vreeland convinced Carolyn Schurner, one of the many successful (and mostly female) designers responsible for the American Look, to recreate a bikini out of mallinson rayon. Toni Frissell, a female photographer who was nurtured by Snow’s all-seeing-eye, shot an iconic image of supermodel Dovima wearing the green and white swimsuit, in repose on a white platform in Montego Bay, Jamaica. Vreeland was born Diana Daizel, to a Scottish father and an American mother, in Paris in 1903, to a family whose ancestors include both Martha Washington and Francis Scott Key. When World War I loomed on the horizon in 1914, they relocated to the United States, eventually settling in New York City. She never finished traditional schooling, and spent what we would now think of as her high school years at a ballet school. She married Thomas Reed Vreeland, who was training to be a banker, on March 1, 1924. The couple moved to London just before the market crash in 1929, where Mr. Vreeland, who went by his middle name, had secured a position with a trust.

(Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images) In London, Vreeland was mostly a socialite-slash-housewife, a mother to two young boys, with the distinction of running her own small lingerie business. That venture is connected to a famous story that apparently Vreeland herself said to be true. That Woman, as Wallis Simpson was snobbily referred to by the unforgiving British press, purchased the nightgown she wore during her first weekend away with Edward, Prince of Wales, from Diana Vreeland. In a wonderful biography written by the incomparable Amy Fine Collins for Vanity Fair in 2011, Vreeland’s son Frecky (Frederick Vreeland) explains that the story became a well-worn family tale, that time when “mom’s store brought down the British empire.” In 1936 the family returned to New York, and in another bit of fashion lore, Vreeland was spotted by Carmel Snow, editor in chief of Harper’s Bazaar between 1934-1958.
