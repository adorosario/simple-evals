Faddeev was the head of the St. Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences (PDMI RAS) from 1976 to 2000. He founded the Euler International Mathematical Institute, now a department of PDMI RAS, in 1988–1992. He held a position of the vice-president of the International Mathematical Union in 1983-1986, and in 1987-1990 became its President. At the same time, he headed the Higher Mathematics and Mathematical Physics Department of the Physical Faculty in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) State University (until 2001), hereafter was a professor of this Department. Ludvig Faddeev is a member of the Presidium of RAS and the St. Petersburg Scientific Centre of RAS. Also, he is an Academician-Secretary of the Department of Mathematical Sciences of RAS. He was the chairman of the Commission for medals and named prizes awarded by the Russian Academy of Sciences till 2016. He is a chief editor of the Functional Analysis and its Applications. He also was an editor-in-chief of the Nature magazine and a part of the first editorial board of the Theoretical and Mathematical Physics magazine. He is a member of editorial boards of the “Journal of Mathematical Physics”, the “Letters in Mathematical Physics”, the “Journal of Functional Analysis”, the “Reviews in Mathematical Physics”, the “Annals of Physics” and others. Ludvig Faddeev said his teachers were Vladimir Fock and Olga Ladyzhenskaya (from the speech at the awarding of the Russian Federation State Prize in 2004). Married to Anna Veselova, a theoretical physicist, has two daughters (Elena, a mathematician, and Maria, a theoretical physicist), four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Scientific research He has made a fundamental contribution to the solution of the three-body problem in quantum mechanics (Faddeev equations); the inverse scattering problem for the Schrödinger equation in three-dimensional case;, in the quantization of non-Abelian gauge fields by the path-integral (Faddeev-Popov ghosts, together with Victor Popov); the creation of the quantum theory of solitons and quantum inverse scattering method in the development of the theory of quantum groups. He has published five books and over 200 scientific papers. At the 23th International Conference on the quantum theory of several particles on August 11, 2016, it was decided to establish the International Ludvig Faddeev medal. Monographs Faddeev L.
