Wilson and Sloan: VFR Flight Into IMC: Reducing the Hazard VFR Flight Into IMC VFR FLIGHT INTO IMC: REDUCING THE HAZARD Dale R. Wilson and Teresa A. Sloan ABSTRACT Aircraft accidents resulting from initiating or continuing visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) continue to be one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents. This paper outlines the nature and scope of this hazard and reviews past and present initiatives designed to reduce it. It also suggests future interventions that may be effective in reducing the threat of this aviation hazard. INTRODUCTION fatalities, making it the leading single cause of aviation Aircraft accidents resulting from initiating or fatalities in that country (TSBC, 1990a). During this continuing visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument period, a combined total of approximately 1770 meteorological conditions (IMC) is one of the leading VFR-into-IMC accidents occurred in both countries, causes of fatal aircraft accidents. When VFR-into-IMC averaging one accident and 1.5 fatalities every two days accident pilots inadvertently enter cloud, they either fly (NTSB, 1989; TSBC, 1990a). Similar findings are reported under controlled flight into terrain (CFTT) or experience for the United Kingdom (UK) where continued flight into spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft adverse weather was responsible for an average of 24% of resulting in an unrecoverable unusual flight attitude (e.g., all single-engine aircraft accidents for the 15 years between spin or graveyard spiral) or inflight structural failure. 1980 and 1994, and one-third of all fatal GA accidents in Studies conducted at the University of Illinois indicate that 1994 alone (Leannount, 1995). for the pilot who does not have adequate instrument flight These data indicate that even though the incidence training, the average time from cloud entry to loss of of VFR-into-IMC accidents is quite low, they are control or ground impact is 178 seconds ("178 seconds," responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of fatal n.d.). Unfortunately, the accident record indicates that VFR accidents and fatalities. For example, the NTSB study flight into IMC continues to be a significant threat to (1989) found 17.3% of all GA accidents resulted in aviation safety. This paper outlines the nature and scope of fatalities, yet a full 72.2% of VFR-into-IMC accidents were the hazard, reviews past and present initiatives designed to fatal.

One-third of GA accidents reflects an overall leveling off of the VFR-into-IMC accidents in the United States involved VFR-into-IMC accident rate as well.

Khatwa and Roelen VFR-into-IMC accidents in the United States between (19%) found that VFR flight into IMC was responsible 1983 and early 1987,62% of pilots were flying their own for at least 19% of worldwide commercial CFTT accidents aircraft and 75% of the accident flights were for personal that occurred between 1988 and 1994. (The percentage is purposes (NTSB, 1989). Between 1989 and 1999, the likely higher since data were missing in 43% of the sample FAA found that 71% of 14 CFR Part 91 aircraft involved accidents.) An even higher percentage is reported in in weather-related accidents were used for personal Canada where over half of the seventy commercial purposes (FAA, n.d).

The role of social adverse weather were finally introduced. However, the pressure, along with how other decision biases may databank continues to be heavily biased toward convective contribute to what has historically been called and turbulence hazards and includes only one question on get-there-itis, is currently being examined by researchers low-pressure systems (altimeter errors).

A role in teaching their students how to avoid a significant increase in the number of questions which seek VFR-into-IMC situation. One way is to simulate to apply weather theory to practical situations, such as hazardous weather recognition and weather-related integrating weather report and forecast questions with a decision making through pencil and paper exercises, sample cross-country trip (as is done in Private Pilot computer-based training (CBT), and one-on-one or group discussions.
