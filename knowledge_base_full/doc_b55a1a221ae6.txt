Skip to main content Home About Us News A week with Terence Tao: the Rism School of Insubria rewards the Californian mathematical genius A week with Terence Tao: the Rism School of Insubria rewards the Californian mathematical genius News date: Tuesday, September 7, 2021Terence Tao, a world renowned mathematician based at the University of California in Los Angeles, has been announced as the first recipient of the Riemann Prize in Mathematics, awarded by the Riemann International School of Mathematics (Rism) of Insubria University in 2019 and then postponed to 2021. The Riemann Prize laureate will participate in person to a week-long celebrations in his honour, culminating in the award ceremony on Friday 24th. Activities will involve not just mathematics. Indeed, a wide cultural tribute which includes local history, literature, figurative arts, music and theatre will set Varese under international spotlights, through the beautiful locations of villa Toeplitz, Varese center, Estense palace, Napoleonic hall at Brera palace in Milano. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) was among the greatest mathematicians of all times. His name is all over modern mathematics and his work served as a crucial tool in Einstein's development of general relativity. He lived and worked mostly in Göttingen, but late in life he traveled through Italy and especially in Insubria. The Riemann Prize was established in 2019, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Rism. Along with Rism and the University of Insubria, the prize has the patronage of all public and private universities of Lombardia, and co-sponsored by the University of Milano, University of Milano-Bicocca, the government of Regione Lombardia, and the municipality of Varese. It will be awarded every three years by an international committee (the first one composed by Enrico Bombieri, Institute for Advanced Studies; Alice Chang, Princeton University; Ron Donagi, University of Pennsylvania, Louis Nirenberg (1925-2020), Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Nyu and Daniele Cassani, the President of Rism, University of Insubria) to outstanding mathematicians aged 40-65 who have reached breakthrough achievements, as a tribute to the prominent figure of Bernhard Riemann. The prize consists of a piece of art made by Master Marcello Morandini and the 18K gold Riemann medal.

Last modified: Tuesday, February 15, 2022 - 16:49 News date: Tuesday, September 7, 2021 Tuesday, September 7, 2021 Tuesday, September 7, 2021 Terence Tao, a world renowned mathematician based at the University of California in Los Angeles, has been announced as the first recipient of the Riemann Prize in Mathematics, awarded by the Riemann International School of Mathematics (Rism) of Insubria University in 2019 and then postponed to 2021. The Riemann Prize laureate will participate in person to a week-long celebrations in his honour, culminating in the award ceremony on Friday 24th. Activities will involve not just mathematics. Indeed, a wide cultural tribute which includes local history, literature, figurative arts, music and theatre will set Varese under international spotlights, through the beautiful locations of villa Toeplitz, Varese center, Estense palace, Napoleonic hall at Brera palace in Milano. Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) was among the greatest mathematicians of all times. His name is all over modern mathematics and his work served as a crucial tool in Einstein's development of general relativity. He lived and worked mostly in Göttingen, but late in life he traveled through Italy and especially in Insubria. The Riemann Prize was established in 2019, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Rism. Along with Rism and the University of Insubria, the prize has the patronage of all public and private universities of Lombardia, and co-sponsored by the University of Milano, University of Milano-Bicocca, the government of Regione Lombardia, and the municipality of Varese. It will be awarded every three years by an international committee (the first one composed by Enrico Bombieri, Institute for Advanced Studies; Alice Chang, Princeton University; Ron Donagi, University of Pennsylvania, Louis Nirenberg (1925-2020), Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Nyu and Daniele Cassani, the President of Rism, University of Insubria) to outstanding mathematicians aged 40-65 who have reached breakthrough achievements, as a tribute to the prominent figure of Bernhard Riemann. The prize consists of a piece of art made by Master Marcello Morandini and the 18K gold Riemann medal.
