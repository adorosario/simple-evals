Editing Recent Changes Changes Needed Sandbox (Test Page) Sitemap Deprived Dark Souls Wiki » Classes » Deprived Description Deprived is a class that lacks any kind of initial specialization, has very minimal starting gear, and lacks any sorceries, pyromancies or miracles. This class can be viewed as a first time player's hardest starting class because all gear throughout the game will have to be obtained or purchased. While the balanced stats may look inviting at first, ultimately they are a hindering factor due to the nature of some stats being fairly undesired with many builds. This class will start out favoring a melee style of play so people more comfortable playing as a mage or archer may want to avoid this as their first class.
