How We Got from Then (1971 ) to Now -­‐-­‐-­‐-­‐ The Annie Jump Cannon Award and the First Working Group on the Status of Women in Astronomy In May 1971 Margaret Burbidge declined the AJC Award -­‐-­‐ “I believe that it is high Ome that discriminaOon in favor of, as well as against women in professional life be removed, and a prize restricted to women is in this category” Underlying this official statement was the suspicion that the AJC award had kept women from receiving other awards. “It would be interesOng to know, however, how oSen our names have been excluded from consideraOon for professorships, directorships … because we are women.” Roberta M.

Margaret Burbidge & Geoffrey Burbidge The Annie Jump Cannon Award -­‐-­‐-­‐ 1932-­‐ 1933 established by Miss Cannon In 1932, she had received the Helen Richards Research Prize of $1000 from the AssociaOon to Aid ScienOfic Research by Women. “I wish to convey through you to the commifee, to the donors, and to all the members of the former AssociaOon … my very great appreciaOon of this prize. I hope to use it to advance, in some way, astronomical research by women”. AJC June 10, 1932 She used the $1000 to endow the Annie Jump Cannon Award to be awarded bienially or triennially to deserving women of any naOonality Rules for the Annie J.

(pg 242 The Glass Universe, by Dava Sobel) . For each prize winner the craSswoman created her own design. Pg 246 Margaret Harwood -­‐-­‐ AJC award 1962 With her papers at the Scheslinger Library for the History of Women in America No consensus on Commifee -­‐-­‐ George Preston (May 1972) described it as a Pandora’s Box -­‐-­‐ ` 2 women – open to men and women, or abolish it, 2 women – keep as is or abolish it and the 3 men sat on the fence.’ Called for a meeOng of AJC Commifee at East Lansing AAS August 1972 There were legal issues and the desires of the bequest The Commifee’s RecommendaOon -­‐-­‐-­‐ 1. The purpose of the award shall conOnue to be to encourage research in astronomy by women 2. The award shall be based on a compeOOon among applicants in the early stages of their careers 3. The award shall be administered by the American AssociaOon of University Women (or similar organizaOon ). That organizaOon will seek professional advice as it desires. No further changes in the rules as adopted in 1933. We suggest that the applicants submit a research proposal and a statement of how the funds will benefit her research. We were allowed to present the recommendaOon to the AAS Council and were given permission to even afend George’s presentaOon and the discussion, BUT not allowed to speak (!). Accepted by Council August 1972 A potenOal divisive development – Margaret Burbidge objected to the recommendaOon -­‐-­‐ discriminatory. Wanted to argue to the Council for “an award a first-­‐class award of internaOonal standing for men and women” Later resolved as “best compromise” . Entered into negoOaOons with AAUW. Finalized in 1973 The AJC Award from 1974 to 2004-­‐-­‐-­‐administered by AAUW To encourage young women to parOcipate in significant research in astronomy not more than 35 years of age career interest in research in astronomy submit a plan of study or research which will advance knowledge and conOnue nominee’s conOnuing achievement no restricOon on naOonality or place or research A nominaOon with a selecOon commifee – 3 from AAS and one from AAUW But as iniOally announced by AAUW, was somewhat different than what the commifee had in mind -­‐-­‐-­‐ no age restricOon (AAUW) 24 young women received it 1974 Beatrice Tinsley 1976 Catherine Garmany 1978 Paula Szkody 1980 Lee Anne Willson 1982 Judith Young 1984 Harriet Dinerstein 1986 Rosemary Wyse ….

That women are not asking for special consideraOon. They request that within the framework of our Society, they be given proper opportunity to develop and use their potenOal for teaching and research. “ CSWA created as standing commifee in 1979 In 2005 the AAS assumed responsibility of the Award from the AAUW which could no longer support the award. In 2005 another ad hoc commifee was appointed Alycia Weinberger (chair), Susana Deustua, Bruce Carney, and Wallace Sargent. The AJC award is now based on outstanding research and promise for future research by a postdoctoral woman researcher. It is given to a North American female astronomer within five years of receiving her PhD in the year designated for the award. A personal anecdote – my Margaret Burbidge/AJC experience 2001 Margaret Burbidge’s rejecOon of the AJC award, its consequences, the first report on the status of women in astronomy were the beginning of increased awareness by AAS of obstacles and discriminaOon against women. QuesOons for today?? How do we view an award just for women today? So have we come full circle? Has the increasing role and visibility of women in science changed how we view an award just for women?
