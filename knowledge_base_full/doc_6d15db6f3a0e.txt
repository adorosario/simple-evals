A Brief History of The Baptist General State Convention of Illinois, Inc.To be sure, the same forces which coalesced to create the rise of Black Baptists in America were at work in the State of Illinois. Long before the Civil War, Blacks migrated from the South, crossed the Mason-Dixon Line, and settled in Illinois .Many slaves and freedmen fled to this new “frontier” in search of favorable conditions for worship. As they arrived, they began to build churches throughout the state, but soon discovered a need to establish a single body to promote their mutual interests.For this reason, a number of Black churches organized the Wood River Baptist District Association on April 27, 1838, in the home of Mr. Samuel Vinson. They held their first session in the Mt. Zion Baptist Church of Ridge 3, Prairie, Illinois, in Madison County, on September 13 of that same year.In 1853 the Providence Baptist Association of Ohio, the Wood River Baptist Association and other churches of the “western” states decided to establish one entity. They organized the Western Colored Baptist Convention. The Convention movement was begun.On September 24, 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia, the National Baptist Convention of the United States of America was formed from the union of the Foreign Mission Convention, the National Baptist Educational Convention, and the American National Baptist Convention. This consolidation of Black Baptists into one national body led to extensive growth. A special report issued in 1906 by the Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census on “Religious Bodies” noted that in 1890 there were 1,348,989 members in the continental United States and by 1906 that number had grown to 2,261,607.The rapid growth in membership led to the need for a state convention within Illinois.

Zion Baptist Church, located at 9th and Carpenter Street in Springfield, Illinois and organized the Baptist General State Convention of Illinois . The Reverend J. F.

A Brief History of The Baptist General State Convention of Illinois, Inc.To be sure, the same forces which coalesced to create the rise of Black Baptists in America were at work in the State of Illinois. Long before the Civil War, Blacks migrated from the South, crossed the Mason-Dixon Line, and settled in Illinois .Many slaves and freedmen fled to this new “frontier” in search of favorable conditions for worship. As they arrived, they began to build churches throughout the state, but soon discovered a need to establish a single body to promote their mutual interests.For this reason, a number of Black churches organized the Wood River Baptist District Association on April 27, 1838, in the home of Mr. Samuel Vinson. They held their first session in the Mt. Zion Baptist Church of Ridge 3, Prairie, Illinois, in Madison County, on September 13 of that same year.In 1853 the Providence Baptist Association of Ohio, the Wood River Baptist Association and other churches of the “western” states decided to establish one entity.

A Brief History of The Baptist General State Convention of Illinois, Inc.To be sure, the same forces which coalesced to create the rise of Black Baptists in America were at work in the State of Illinois. Long before the Civil War, Blacks migrated from the South, crossed the Mason-Dixon Line, and settled in Illinois .Many slaves and freedmen fled to this new “frontier” in search of favorable conditions for worship. As they arrived, they began to build churches throughout the state, but soon discovered a need to establish a single body to promote their mutual interests.For this reason, a number of Black churches organized the Wood River Baptist District Association on April 27, 1838, in the home of Mr. Samuel Vinson. They held their first session in the Mt. Zion Baptist Church of Ridge 3, Prairie, Illinois, in Madison County, on September 13 of that same year.In 1853 the Providence Baptist Association of Ohio, the Wood River Baptist Association and other churches of the “western” states decided to establish one entity. They organized the Western Colored Baptist Convention. The Convention movement was begun.On September 24, 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia, the National Baptist Convention of the United States of America was formed from the union of the Foreign Mission Convention, the National Baptist Educational Convention, and the American National Baptist Convention. This consolidation of Black Baptists into one national body led to extensive growth. A special report issued in 1906 by the Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census on “Religious Bodies” noted that in 1890 there were 1,348,989 members in the continental United States and by 1906 that number had grown to 2,261,607.The rapid growth in membership led to the need for a state convention within Illinois. On October 2, 1902, sixty-four years after the beginning of the Wood River Baptist Association, a group of Baptist met at the Mt. Zion Baptist Church, located at 9th and Carpenter Street in Springfield, Illinois and organized the Baptist General State Convention of Illinois . The Reverend J. F. Thomas, Minister of the Olivet Baptist Church, was elected as the first President of the Convention. He served in this capacity from 1902 to 1909.During the Annual Session of 1909, held in Quincy, Illinois, at the First Baptist Church, Reverend F. J. Fisher was elected to succeed Dr. J. F. Thomas.

Williams of Joliet succeeded Reverend McCoo and served through the 1917 Annual Session, held at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church of Cairo, Illinois.It was during this Annual Session of the State Convention that another Pastor of the Olivet Baptist Church of Chicago, ascended to the Presidency. Dr. L. K. Williams served as President until he was chosen as leader of the National Convention. In September of 1922, in the city of St. Louis, MO., Dr. L. K. Williams was elected President of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A. Inc. Consequently, in January of 1923, Dr. Williams resigned the office of President of Baptist General State Convention of Illinois in order to devote more time to his national responsibilities.The Vice President, Rev. J. J. Olive ascended to the Presidency of the State Convention, completing the year, and was elected to his own term in June of that same year. Dr. Olive served as President of Baptist General until the Master called him from labor to reward on September 2, 1937. Upon the death of Dr. Olive, Dr. William Bennett of Chicago, the Vice President, finished the unexpired term and was elected President in June of 1938, during the Annual Session held at the True Light Baptist Church of East St. Louis, Illinois. He served as President through the June Session of 1939, held with the Mt. Zion Baptist Church of Peoria, Illinois.During the Peoria Session of 1939, Dr. J. L. Horace, Pastor of the Monumental Baptist Church of Chicago, was elected President, succeeding Dr. Bennett. Dr. Horace was an outstanding leader. He was recognized as having built one of the greatest programs ever witnessed in any state since slavery. During his administration, Dr. Horace unified the State; greatly increased missions, Christian education, church extension, evangelism and the L. K. Williams Memorial Scholarship Fund. He also led the Convention in the purchasing of a Headquarters, as well as establishing the General Baptist Advocate as the mouthpiece of the Convention.
