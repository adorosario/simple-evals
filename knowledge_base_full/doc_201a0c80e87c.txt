See individual weapons page for details. Key Name: Names displayed are according to the Atlus (NA) version of the game. Name changes from the Asian version, if any, will appear in parentheses. Damage: The Damage stat dictates how much damage the weapon does. The Damage stats for a weapon are X / Y / Z: X is Physical Damage Y is Magical Damage Z is Fire Damage Bleed, Poison and Plague are bonus damage over a period of 60 seconds. So, if a weapon has "Bleed 120", the victim will suffer 120 damage over 60 seconds, or 2 damage per second. Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Normal Blunt Slashing Piercing Certain enemies are weak or strong against different types of damage types. Durability: The durability of the weapon. The effectiveness of the weapon will severely deteriorate when the durability falls below 30%. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 50% of your Equip Burden will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. StatsNeeded: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The Requirement stats for a weapon are W / X / Y / Z: W is the Strength required X is the Dexterity required Y is the Magic required Z is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 50% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 18 Strength can wield a Great Axe (Requires 26 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (18 x 1.5 = 27) StatBonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). page revision: 157, last edited: 02 Jul 2020 20:52 Edit Rate (0) Tags Discuss (0) History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.
