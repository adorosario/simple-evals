The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole.

Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features.Â The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
