The fireworks incorporated an actual lunar meteorite so that pieces of the moon were scattered on the grounds of Jupiter Artland. 'Nocturne (A Moon Landing)' took place on the eve of the full moon on the 9 May 2009 and was part of an ongoing series of Moon Landings made by Parker. The firework display was inspired by Whistler’s 'Nocturne in Black and Gold The Falling Rocket' (1875) – a depiction of a firework-strewn sky much criticised by John Ruskin, who likened it to 'flinging a pot of paint in the public’s face' – and Claude Debussy’s musical 'Nocturnes', which in their turn had been inspired by Whistler.
