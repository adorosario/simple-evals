Jon Kleinberg Award Recipient Jon Kleinberg ACM AAAI Allen Newell Award (2014) ACM Fellows (2013) ACM Prize in Computing (2008) 2014 ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award Recipient ACM AAAI Allen Newell Award USA - 2014 citation For groundbreaking work in computer science in areas including social and information networks, information retrieval, and data science, and for bridging computing, economics and the social sciences. Kleinberg's work is noted for its diversity, creativity, scholarship and brilliance. He has contributed in deeply significant ways to our understanding of information networks and the people who use them, recognizing that one cannot fully understand the former without studying the latter. This has included the understanding of hubs and authorities in the hyperlinked structure of the World Wide Web, path discovery in small world networks, and influence spread (contagion) in networks. His masterful book (joint with the economist David Easley) Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected World won the Lanchester Prize in 2011 for the best contribution to operations research and the management sciences published in English in the previous three years. His work on the bursty behavior of temporal data streams has also been highly influential, and he has contributed important results across a wide variety of additional areas, including algorithmic graph theory, clustering, high-dimensional algorithmic geometry, game theory, approximation algorithms, queuing theory, social choice and computational biology. Kleinberg's work effectively combines both theory and experiment, with far-reaching impacts on everyday activities such as web search, while embodying and foreshadowing a convergence between computing and the social sciences. Press Release ACM Fellows USA - 2013 citation For contributions to the science of information and social networks. ACM Prize in Computing USA - 2008 citation For his contributions to the science of networks and the World Wide Web. His work is a deep combination of social insights and mathematical reasoning. Jon Kleinberg's work on the use of link analysis led to the design of vastly improved algorithms for Web search. His connection between network structure and information was a fundamental breakthrough that has transformed the way that information is retrieved on the Web. His work on the small world phenomenon provides deep insight into the structure of networks and helps explain the social phenomenon of "six degrees of separation." 2014 ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award Recipient Jon Kleinberg is the 2014 recipient of the ACM – AAAI Allen Newell Award for groundbreaking work in computer science on social and information networks, information retrieval, and data science, and for bridging computing, economics and the social sciences. Kleinberg contributed to the development of link analysis, a search technique that ranks the absolute number as well as the most relevant, trusted sources of pages linked to a Web search query. His innovative models and algorithms have broadened the scope of computer science to extend its influence to the burgeoning world of the Web and the social connections it enables. Kleinberg is the Tisch University Professor of Computer Science and Information Science at Cornell University. A MacArthur Fellow, he is the recipient of the 2008 ACM-Infosys Foundation Award.
