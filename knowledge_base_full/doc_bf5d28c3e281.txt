Bertrand’s analysis of baccarat Stewart N. Ethier Abstract Joseph Bertrand [1822–1900], who is often credited with a model of duopoly that has a unique Nash equilibrium, made another significant contribution to game theory. Specifically, his 1888 analysis of baccarat was the starting point for Borel’s investigation of strategic games in the 1920s. Inthispaperweshow,withnearcertainty,thatBertrand’sresults on baccarat were borrowed, without attribution, from an 1881 paper of Albert Badoureau [1853–1923]. In addition, we discuss Borel’s criticisms of Bertrand’s analysis, one of which helps to explain why Badoureau’s contribution was overlooked until now. Keywords: baccarat chemin de fer, noncooperative game, pure strategy, best response. 1 Introduction In The History of Game Theory, Volume I: From the Beginnings to 1945 (Di- mand and Dimand, 1996, p. 132), we find, “As Borel (1924, p. 101) noted, the starting-point for his investigation of strategic games was the analysis of baccarat by Bertrand.” In Borel’s (1924) own words,1 The only author who has studied a particular case of the problem we envisage is Joseph Bertrand, in the passage of his calculus of probabilities that he devotes to the draw at five in the game of baccarat;thereheclearlydistinguishesthepurelymathematicalside of the problem from the psychological side, because he asks, on the one hand, if the punter has an advantage in drawing at five when the banker knows the punter’s manner of play and, on the other hand, if the punter has an advantage in drawing at five by letting the banker believe, if he can, that it is not his custom; he also poses the same questions for the non-draw at five. But, as we will see from what follows, this study is extremely incomplete; on the one hand, Bertrand does not investigate what would happen if the punter would draw at five in a certain fraction of the total number ofcoupsand,ontheotherhand,hedoesnotinvestigatewhetherthe banker’s opinion on the draw at five of the punter does not affect 1ThisisaneditedversionofSavage’s(1953) translation. 1 3202 raM 72 ]OH.htam[ 6v89100.7012:viXra the way the banker plays in some cases where the punter does not have five, which may result in an advantage for either player in the whole game. We see, by these brief indications, how complex is the problem approached by Bertrand, in spite of the rudimentary simplicity of the game of baccarat; [.]. To describe Bertrand’s results, we must first explain the rules of the two- person zero-sum game of baccarat (more precisely, baccarat chemin de fer). The gameis dealtfroma shoe comprisingsix 52-carddecksmixed together. Denominations A, 2–9, 10, J, Q, K have values 1, 2–9, 0, 0, 0, 0, respectively, and suits are irrelevant. The total of a hand, comprising two or three cards, is the sum of the values of the cards, modulo 10. In other words, only the final digit of the sum is used to evaluate a hand. Two cards are dealt face down to Playerandtwoface downto Banker,andeachlooksonlyathis ownhand. The object of the game is to have the higher total (closer to 9) at the end of play. A two-card total of 8 or 9 is a natural. If either hand is a natural, the game is over. Ifneither handis anatural,Playerthenhasthe optionofdrawingathird card. If he exercises this option, his third card is dealt face up. Next, Banker, observing Player’s third card, if any, has the option of drawing a third card. This completes the game, and the higher total wins. Winning bets on Player’s hand are paid at even odds, with Banker, as the name suggests, playing the role of the bank. Losing bets on Player’s hand are collected by Banker. Hands of equal total result in a tie (no money is exchanged). Since multiple players can bet on Player’s hand, Player’s strategy is restricted. He must draw on a two-card total of 4 or less and stand on a two-card total of 6 or 7. When his two-card total is 5, he is free to stand or draw as he chooses. (The decision is usually made by the player with the largest bet.) In much of the French baccarat literature, a Player who always draws at 5 is called a tireur; likewise, a Player who always stands at 5 is called a non-tireur. Banker, on whose hand no one canbet, has no constraints onhis strategyin the classicalversionof the game considered here. Bertrand (1888, pp. 39–40)states his problem precisely: We must solve four problems: The player having 5 and not requesting a card, what is the prob- ability for him to win and what is that of a tie, when the banker, unaware that he has the point 5, knows that he has the custom, when he has this point, of not requesting a card? The player having 5 and not requesting a card, what are the prob- abilities for him to win or to tie, when the banker, unaware that he has the point 5, knows that he has the custom, when he has this point, of requesting a card? The player having 5 and requesting a card, what are the probabili- ties for him to win or to tie, when the banker knows his custom of requesting a card in this circumstance or when he thinks he knows that he does not request one? 2 Keep in mind that, in the late 19th century, game theory did not yet exist, sotermssuchas“purestrategy”and“bestresponse,”whichweusebelow,were not yet in common usage. Inthenextsectionweshowhowtosolvethesefourproblems. InSection3we compareourresultswiththoseofBertrandandthoseofBertrand’spredecessors in the analysis of baccarat, Dormoy (1872) and Badoureau (1881). Finally, in Section 4 we discuss Borel’s criticisms of Bertrand’s analysis. The principal characters in the story include: • JosephBertrand[1822–1900],professorofmathematicsatE´colePolytech- nique. He contributed to several areas of mathematics, including proba- bility, in which he is best known for the ballot theorem and “Bertrand’s paradox” (concerning a random chord of a circle). • E´mile Dormoy [1829–1891], a French mining engineer and actuary. He publishednumerousbooks,includingthreeoncardgames(baccarat,bouil- lotte, and´ecart´e). His best-knownworkis the 1878book, Th´eorie math´e- matique des assurances sur la vie, in two volumes. • Albert Badoureau [1853–1923], a French mining engineer and amateur mathematician. He is best known for his 1878 discovery of 37 of the 75 non-prismatic uniform polyhedra. He was also scientific advisor to Jules Verne and wrote a technical appendix to Topsy Turvy. • E´mile Borel [1871–1956], professor of mathematics at the Sorbonne and one of the great French mathematicians. He was one of the founders of the theory of functions of a realvariable,and he was anearly contributor to game theory. Despite their 49-year age difference, Borel knew Bertrand personally (Bru, 2006, note 12); in fact, Borel’s wife was granddaughter of Bertrand’s elder brother. Moreover, it is very likely that Badoureau and Bertrand also knew each other. Badoureau, having been ranked first in his class at E´cole Polytech- nique, was responsible for writing the course handouts for his fellow students. This would have included the first-year analysis course, which was offered in alternate years by Bertrand and Charles Hermite [1822–1901]. Records show thatBertrandtaughtthe 1878class andBadoureauwasin the 1874class. This suggeststhat Badoureau’sprofessorfor this subject wasBertrand,not Hermite (BernardBru,personalcommunication, 2021;JacquesCrovisier,personalcom- munication, 2021). It is also possible that Dormoy and Bertrand knew each other, for Dormoy ranked fourth in his class at E´cole Polytechnique, though this was while Bertrand was still a tutor in analysis, before being promoted to professor (Bru and Jongmans, 2001). 2 Solution of Bertrand’s problems There are four scenarios. Player has a two-card total of 5 and can stand or draw. Bankerreplies with abest response(unawareofPlayer’stwo-cardtotal), 3 assumingeitherthatPlayerisanon-tireur orthatPlayerisatireur. Sothefirst step is to derive Banker’s best response to each of Player’s two pure strategies. We assume, as is conventional, that cards are drawn with replacement (or, equivalently,thatthe shoe hasinfinitely manydecks). We cansummarizethese best responses in terms of two 8×11 incidence matrices, 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1     D = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 , D = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 , 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1     0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1     0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     in which rows are labeled by Banker’s two-card total, 0–7, and columns are labeled by Player’s third card, 0–9 and ∅, where ∅ means that Player stands. Entries are 0 for stand and 1 for draw, with D giving Banker’s best response 0 whenPlayeris knownto be a non-tireur,andD givingBanker’sbestresponse 1 when Player is known to be a tireur. Notice that D and D differ at four entries: At (3,9), (4,1), (5,4), and 0 1 (6,∅), D has a 0 and D has a 1. 0 1 How are D and D derived? Let p(i) := (1+3δ )/13 (i = 0,1,.,9) 0 1 i,0 be the distribution of the value of a third card, and q(j) := (16+9δ )/(13)2 j,0 (j =0,1,.,9) be the distribution of the value of a two-cardhand. Define the function M on the set of nonnegative integers by M(i) := mod(i,10). Then, for u ∈ {0,1}, the (j,k) entry of D is 1 if, when Banker’s two-card total is j u andPlayer’sthirdcardisk,Banker’sexpectedprofitbydrawingisgreaterthan Banker’s expected profit by standing, that is, if b (j,k)>b (j,k), where u,1 u,0 4+u 4+u b (j,k):= sgn(j−M(i+k))q(i) q(i), u,0 (cid:30) Xi=0 Xi=0 (1) 4+u 9 4+u b (j,k):= sgn(M(j+l)−M(i+k))q(i)p(l) q(i), u,1 (cid:30) Xi=0Xl=0 Xi=0 when j ∈{0,1,.,7} and k ∈{0,1,.,9}, and 7 7 b (j,∅):= sgn(j−i)q(i) q(i), u,0 (cid:30) i=X5+u i=X5+u (2) 7 9 7 b (j,∅):= sgn(M(j+l)−i)q(i)p(l) q(i), u,1 (cid:30) i=X5+uXl=0 i=X5+u when j ∈{0,1,.,7}. One can go on to express the 2×288 payoff matrix for baccaratin terms of the conditional expectations (1) and (2) and then eliminate strictly dominated purestrategiesandsolvethegame. SeeEthier(2010,Chapter5)forfulldetails. 4 In each of the equations in (1) and (2), Player’s two-card total is random, sothesequantitieswillnothelpus solveBertrand’sproblems,inwhichPlayer’s two-cardtotalis 5. But we do need D and D to addressthese problems. Let 0 1 f be a function on the set of integers and define 9 7 A := f(5−M(j+l))q(j)p(l) q(j) 0,v (cid:30) 0≤Xj≤7: Xl=0 Xj=0 Dv(j,∅)=1 7 + f(5−j)q(j) q(j) (3) (cid:30) 0≤Xj≤7: Xj=0 Dv(j,∅)=0 and 9 7 A := f(M(5+k)−M(j+l))q(j)p(k)p(l) q(j) 1,v (cid:30) 0≤j≤7X,0≤k≤9: Xl=0 Xj=0 Dv(j,k)=1 7 + f(M(5+k)−j)q(j)p(k) q(j). (4) (cid:30) 0≤j≤7X,0≤k≤9: Xj=0 Dv(j,k)=0 Then, with f equalto the indicator ofthe set of positive integers, A is W , u,v u,v theprobabilityofaPlayerwin;withf equaltotheindicatorof{0},A isT , u,v u,v the probability of a Player tie; and with f(x) := sgn(x), A is E , Player’s u,v u,v expected profit. In all cases, u=0 (resp., u=1) if Player has a two-cardtotal of 5 (with Banker unaware of this) and stands (resp., draws), and v =0 (resp., v = 1) if Banker assumes that Player is a non-tireur (resp., tireur) and makes a best response. Notice another distinction between (1)–(2) and (3)–(4). In the former, the u variable signifies Player’s pure strategy, and the v variable signifies Banker’s stand-or-draw decision based on the available information. In the latter, the u variablesignifiesPlayer’sstand-or-drawdecisionwithatwo-cardtotalof5,and the v variable signifies what Banker assumes is Player’spure strategy,to which Banker makes a best response.

Dormoy’s (1872) article (and nearly identical book (1873)) was the first mathematicalstudy ofbaccaratchemindefer, thoughhe referredto itas“bac- carattournant”(rotatingbaccarat). He obtainedthe equivalentofD andD , 0 1 in the form of two tables, with only one error in each. He argued that it is indifferent whether Banker stands or draws at (5,4) when Player is known to be a non-tireur. This is not really an error, just a consequence of rounding ex- pectations to two decimal places (the standing expectation is −299/1157, and the drawing expectation is −300/1157; both round to −0.26). He also had an error in D at (6,6). 1 Dormoy addressed three of Bertrand’s four problems, at least in terms of expectations, but rounded them to two or three decimal places. He obtained E ≈ −0.024, E ≈ 0.012, and E ≈ 0.02 (Section 79); these numbers 0,0 1,0 1,1 should have been −0.025, 0.021, and 0.01. He provided enough detail to allow one to check that his methodology was sound, so the errors were only compu- tational. ThesecondmathematicalstudyofbaccaratchemindeferwasbyBadoureau (1881), who was aware of Dormoy’s work. He had D exactly correct but had 0 2None of the 19th-century baccarat authors got D 0 and D 1 exactly right. This includes Billard(1883), Bertez`ene(1889, 1896, 1897), Hoffmann(1891a,b), andLaun(1891), inaddi- tion to Dormoy (1872), Badoureau (1881), and Bertrand (1888). We can add 20th-century baccarat authors Savigny (1906), Lafaye and Krauss (1927), and Huitte (1928) to this list. (To be fair, Lafaye and Krauss assumed a different model of card distribution.) Thus, the firsttogetD 0 andD 1 exactlyrightwereLafrogne(1927), LeMyre(1935), andBoll(1936). Jules Louis Henry Lafrogne [1867–1933] was a Rear Admiral in the French Navy. As far as we know, his baccarat book is his only publication. “Georges Le Myre” was said (in a 1937 review ofhis book) tobe thepseudonym ofaprofessor ofmathematics well known inParis, but his identity is unknown today. Marcel Boll [1886–1971] was professor of Chemistry and Electricityatl’E´coledesHautes E´tudesCommercialesinParis. 3Froma3August2000emailfromJ.LaurieSnelltoR´egisDeloche. 6 three errors in D , at (4,1), (4,9), and (6,6). Badoureau expressed D , for 1 0 example, in terms of a list of rules for Banker: 1. Always draw at baccarat [i.e., zero], one or two; 2. Always stand at seven; 3. Before a player who stands, draw at 3, at 4 or at 5 and stand at 6; 4. Before a player who has taken a card, always draw at 3 unless one has given 8 or 9; always draw at 4, unless one has given 8, 9, 0 or 1; only draw at 5 if one has given 5, 6 or 7; only draw at 6 if one has given 6 or 7. Badoureau addressed all four of Bertrand’s problems and expressed his an- swers as fractions: 792 153 44 W = , T = , E =− , (7a) 0,0 0,0 0,0 1781 1781 1781 872 169 132 W = , T = , E = , (7b) 0,1 0,1 0,1 1781 1781 1781 10352 2928 479 W = , T = , E = , (7c) 1,0 1,0 1,0 23153 23153 23153 10288 2800 223 W = , T = , E = . (7d) 1,1 1,1 1,1 23153 23153 23153 Actually, instead of finding E , Badoureau evaluated what he called Player’s u,v chances, C := W + 1T . Then E = 2C −1, so E and C are u,v u,v 2 u,v u,v u,v u,v u,v effectively equivalent. Finally, Bertrand (1888), who did not reveal D or D and cited no prior 0 1 work, expressed his results to six decimal places: W ≈0.444694, T ≈0.085907, E ≈−0.024706, (8a) 0,0 0,0 0,0 W ≈0.489612, T ≈0.094890, E ≈0.074115, (8b) 0,1 0,1 0,1 W ≈0.447113, T ≈0.126463, E ≈0.020689, (8c) 1,0 1,0 1,0 W ≈0.444348, T ≈0.120935, E ≈0.009631. (8d) 1,1 1,1 1,1 Actually, Bertrand found L = 1−W −T , the probability of a Player u,v u,v u,v loss, instead of E =W −L =2W +T −1. u,v u,v u,v u,v u,v We find that (8a)–(8c), (7a)–(7c), and (5a)–(5c) (equiv., (6a)–(6c)) match exactly, ignoring rounding errors in the sixth decimal place. But (8d) matches (7d),whichdiffersfrom(5d)(equiv.,(6d)). HowdidBadoureauarriveatW = 1,1 10288/23153, for example? When we recompute (3)–(4) for the appropriate f with D changed in three places (at (4,1), (4,9), and (6,6)) to account for 1 Badoureau’s errors, we obtain Badoureau’s numbers exactly. For Bertrand to have derived his results independently of Badoureau, he would have had to have made no errors in the 88 entries of D and exactly 0 the same three errors as Badoureau made in the 88 entries of D . This seems 1 7 extremelyunlikely,andperhapsthereisnoneedtoquantifyit. Weconcludethat Bertrand borrowed Badoureau’s results without confirming them and without attribution. As Sheynin (1994) pointed out, Bertrand had the custom of not fully acknowledging prior work. Was Bertrand’s interpretation of the results more insightful than Badou- reau’s? Bertrand (1888, p. 42) wrote: If, without trying to outwit the other, from the beginning of the game he frankly declares his customs, he should draw at 5. If the conventions of the game allow deception, he should stand at 5, making the banker think, if he can, that he has the custom of drawing. Compare this with Badoureau (1881): If one were required to make known in advance the rule of conduct thatoneproposestofollow,itwouldbebettertodrawthantostand, [.]. Theplayermustthereforestandat5whilelettingthebankerbelieve the opposite. The conclusions are similar. See Guilbaud (1961) for discussion. 4 Borel’s criticism of Bertrand’s analyis Aswesaw,thefirstreasonthatBorelcharacterizedBertrand’sstudyofbaccarat as“extremelyincomplete”wasitslackofconsiderationofmixedstrategies. But both Dormoy (1872) and, to a lesser extent, Badoureau (1881) did consider a Player (1,1) mixed strategy, although not entirely correctly. A Banker best 2 2 responsetothismixedstrategywasregarded,beforegametheory,astheappro- priateresponsewhenBankerwasunawareofPlayer’scustomarybehavior. Inef- fect,DormoyfoundBanker’sbestmoveat(j,k)∈{0,1,.,7}×{0,1,.,9,∅} by determining which of b (j,k)+b (j,k) 0,v 1,v , v ∈{0,1}, 2 islarger. Amoreaccurateapproachwouldhavecomparedtheweightedaverages 89b (j,k)+105b (j,k) 0,v 1,v , v ∈{0,1}, 89+105 if k 6=∅, or 48b (j,∅)+32b (j,∅) 0,v 1,v , v ∈{0,1}, 48+32 where the factor 89 (resp., 105, 48, and 32), when divided by 137, is the con- ditional probability that Player’s two-card total belongs to {0,1,2,3,4} (resp., {0,1,2,3,4,5},{5,6,7},and {6,7}), given that it is neither 8 nor 9. 8 Badoureau, on the other hand, made a more egregious error by using in effect the averages E +E 44 E +E 351 0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1 = ≈0.024705 and = ≈0.015160 2 1781 2 23153 (or 327/23153≈ 0.014123 for the second expression if the error in E is cor- 1,1 rected). This mistake was said by Boll (1936, p. 234) to be common: Thefirstideathatwouldcometomindwouldbethattheadvantage would be the average of the advantages [.]. This simplistic idea, which is accepted without reflection by most players,iscompletely wrong: itmusttakeintoaccountallthedetails of the tactic. Indeed, one should use (3)–(4) with f(x) := sgn(x) and D replaced by D , v 1/2 definedto be equalto D exceptfor1s at(3,9)and(5,4). The latter approach 0 yields 44 287 E =− ≈−0.024705 and E = ≈0.012396 0,1/2 1781 1,1/2 23153 for Player’s standing and drawing expectations in this scenario. With these numbers, Badoureau might not have come to the conclusion that “it is almost indifferent to draw or to stand at 5.” Incidentally, D is 1/2 Banker’s mandatory strategy in today’s nonstrategic form of baccarat, often calledbaccaratpunto banco. We have arguedelsewhere (Ethier and Lee, 2015) that this is not a coincidence. ItappearsthatLasker(1929)wasthefirstauthortoconsideramixedstrat- egyotherthan(1,1)inthebaccaratsetting,andhisanalysiswascorrect,albeit 2 2 for a simplified version of the game. See Bewersdorff (2020) for discussion. The second of Borel’s criticisms of Bertrand’s study is arguably even more fundamental. Can one answer the question of whether Player should draw at 5 by examining only coups in which Player has a two-card total of 5, or must all Player two-card totals be included in the analysis? We would argue for the latter approach. For example, the first of Bertrand’s four problems was the following: The player having 5 and not requesting a card, what is the prob- ability for him to win and what is that of a tie, when the banker, unaware that he has the point 5, knows that he has the custom, when he has this point, of not requesting a card? We believe that the problem would have been better formulated as follows: What is the probability for the player to win and what is that of a tie, under the following two assumptions: (a) If the playerhas 5, he does not request a card. (b) The banker knows that the player has the custom, when he has the point 5, of not requesting a card. 9 As we have seen, the solution to the original problem is 792 153 44 W = , T = , E =− , (9) 0,0 0,0 0,0 1781 1781 1781 whereas the solution of the reformulated problem is 2152648 447337 74176 W = , T = , E =− . (10) 0,0 0,0 0,0 4826809 4826809 4826809 Thedistinctionisclear: BothsetsofstatisticsassumethatPlayerisanon-tireur andBankerknowsit. ButE in(10)isPlayer’smeanprofitfromanarbitrary 0,0 coup, whereas E in (9) is Player’s mean profit on only those coups in which 0,0 he starts with a two-cardtotal of 5. The latter statistic, having been taken out of context, is of dubious value. Another waytolookatthisis toconsiderthe 2×2matrixgamewithpayoff matrix B: assumes P stands at 5 B: assumes P draws at 5 P: stands at 5 E E 0,0 0,1 (11) P: draws at 5 (cid:18) E 1,0 E 1,1 (cid:19) Playeristhe rowplayer,hasatwo-cardtotalof5,andstands ordraws.

The equilibrium for this gameisnotmeaningfulbecauseafterafewplaysBankerwillrealizethatPlayer always has a two-cardtotal of 5 and adjust his strategy accordingly. On the other hand, if (11) were replaced by B: assumes P stands at 5 B: assumes P draws at 5 P: stands at 5 E E 0,0 0,1 , P: draws at 5 (cid:18) E 1,0 E 1,1 (cid:19) with Player not assumed to have a two-card total of 5, the game could be playedrepeatedly andthe equilibrium wouldbe meaningful, evenif not exactly the game-theoretic solution of baccarat. It is, in fact, essentially the solution found by Kendall and Murchland (1964), who were unaware of Kemeny and Snell (1957). It is for this reason, we suspect, that, with one exception,4 no subsequent researcher attempted to reproduce Bertrand’s numbers, and therefore no one noticed the identical errors in Bertrand’s and Badoureau’s work. Above all, we wantto emphasize thatBorel(1924)wasmistakeninwriting, “The only author who has studied a particularcase of the problemwe envisage is Joseph Bertrand, [.].” Game theorists might point to Charles Waldegrave, who solved the game of le her in 1713, as a counter-example (Guilbaud, 1961; 4Lafaye and Krauss (1927, Chap. XI) correctly solved two of Bertrand’s four problems, including the one he got wrong. Yet they stated, not entirely accurately, that their results wereinconformitywiththoseofBertrand. 10 DimandandDimand,1996,Chapter7;BellhouseandFillion,2015),butAlbert Badoureau is a more contemporaneous counter-example. Badoureau died in 1923so did not have the opportunity to correctthe record. Therefore,nearly a century later, we do so here.
