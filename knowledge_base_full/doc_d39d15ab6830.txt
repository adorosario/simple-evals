Home / About AAAI / AAAI Awards and Recognitions / AAAI/EAAI Patrick Henry Winston Outstanding Educator Award The annual AAAI/EAAI Outstanding Educator award was created in 2016 to honor a person (or group of people) who has made major contributions to AI education that provides long-lasting benefits to the AI community and society as a whole. Examples include innovating teaching methods, providing service to the AI education community, generating pedagogical resources, designing curricula, and educating students outside of higher education venues (or the general public) about AI. The award consists of a certificate, a $1,000 honorarium, complimentary one-year AAAI membership (new or renewal), and complimentary conference registration to the upcoming EAAI/AAAI conferences, where the award will be conferred. The award was named in 2023 in honor of Patrick Henry Winston. Professor Winston was a pioneering and beloved AI educator. In his 50 years of teaching at MIT, perhaps 10,000 students took his Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. He introduced many more to AI through one of the first and most influential early AI textbooks. His “Introduction to AI” lectures live on in MIT OpenCourseWare, where they are routinely viewed from around the world. He also taught a course entitled the Human Intelligence Enterprise, where the focus was on developing both an analytical mind and the ability to communicate clearly. He was a brilliant communicator who shared his wisdom in this regard through an annual lecture on “How to Speak,” an online version of which has attracted over 13M views, and through his last book: Make It Clear: Speak and Write to Persuade and Inform. He was well-known for his informative and accessible lectures, during which he could move quickly from the details of an algorithm to the larger issues that it illustrated, then onto even bigger lessons about being a scientist – and a human being. He earned many honors for his teaching. He also earned many personal tributes as an accessible and inspiring, wise, and kind teacher and mentor. He earned many formal honors for his teaching but was particularly known for — and took great pride in — being a teacher and mentor who was accessible, inspiring, wise, and kind.
