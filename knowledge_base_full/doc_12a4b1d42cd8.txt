No recent wiki edits to this page. StorylineTen years before his own death, a French scientist experimented on a large gorilla that was stronger and more agile than other gorillas. At first he planned to transplant his mind into this mighty body, but after looking on the ape's face, he changed his mind and decided to enhance his brain activity. Through secret methods and shock treatments, the scientist greatly increased the ape's intelligence. The gorilla gained an IQ of 178, making him a genius. The scientist also gave the ape the ability to speak human languages. He named the gorilla Monsieur Mallah and trained him to read and write, and taught him all about science and medicine.When the scientist died, Mallah followed the instructions he had left him and removed his mentor's brain, surgically transferring it to a sophisticated recepticle that was connected to a vast computer network. The recepticle enabled the brain to remain alive and to monitor events around it and even to speak through special equipment. The scientist, who became the Brain, assisted by Mallah, organized the original Brotherhood of Evil to advance his goals of achieving power and wealth.One member of the Brotherhood was Laura DeMille, whose mind was altered by the Brain and Mallah so that she became the evil Madame Rouge. The Brotherhood clashed many times with the Doom Patrol. Finally, Madame Rouge double crossed the Brain and Mallah, seemingly blowing them up in their Parisian headquarters.However, the Brain and Mallah survived and they remained in hiding for a number of years before forming a new Brotherhood of Evil who battled the New Teen Titans.Monsieur Mallah joined Alexander Luthor's Secret Society of Super Villains.Monsieur Mallah was killed by Gorilla Grodd on planet Salvation.
