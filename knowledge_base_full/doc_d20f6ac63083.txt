Episodes[] No. in season Title Original air date 1 "Week 1" May 23, 2011 Season 7 premiere: Dental student Ashley Hebert, Brad Womack's 2011 second runner-up, meets 25 potential husbands as limousines disgorge them at the show's Malibu mansion. Among them: a butcher, a fellow dentist, a masked man and a guy she already knows. Then comes the first cocktail party, at which one contestant sings to Ashley, another introduces her to his mother (by speakerphone) and a third, alas, takes the "cocktail" part of the party too seriously. Seven don't make it to Week 2. 2 "Week 2" May 30, 2011 The 18 opening-night survivors move into the mansion. One guy snares Ashley's first kiss, on a Las Vegas one-on-one date that includes wedding preparations. Another attends a private Colbie Caillat performance, also in Vegas. And 12 others dance with the hip-hop crew Jabbawockeez during a group date. And before three contenders are sent home, the masked man doffs his mask. 3 "Week 3" June 6, 2011 A flash mob and a comedy roast that scalds the Bachelorette are among the highlights as Ashley cuts the field from 15 to 12. The mob appears at an open-air L.A. mall, where Ashley and her date are dancing. And the roast is at L.A.'s Comedy Store, where one guy acts childishly and another cruelly. In fact, Ashley is so distraught that she cancels the cocktail party, leaving candidates who made a bad impression on her unable to make amends. 4 "Week 4: Phuket, Thailand" June 13, 2011 Ashley and 12 guys visit Phuket, Thailand, where she and 10 of them visit an orphanage for children who lost their families in the 2004 tsunami. There are also kayaking and shopping expeditions before Ashley reduces the field to 11. Next stop: Chiang Mai, Thailand. 5 "Week 5: Chian Mai, Thailand" June 20, 2011 Ashley and 11 suitors visit Chiang Mai, Thailand, where three are eliminated. But first, one accompanies her to an ancient temple and eight others engage in Muay Thai boxing (and must fight each other). There's also a two-on-one river-rafting expedition, in which the elephants are playful and the guys nervous. One guy is also loose-lipped. 6 "Week 6: Hong Kong, China" June 27, 2011 Ashley visits Hong Kong with her eight remaining suitors. Before two are eliminated, one dines with her on a junk boat and another goes with her to Victoria's Peak Park. For the six others, it's a day at the races - dragon-boat races - at Stanley Beach. 7 "Week 7: Taiwan, China" July 11, 2011 Ashley arrives in Taiwan with six bachelors, two of whom will be sent home. But first there are three one-on-one dates (a countryside scooter ride, and visits to a temple and a national park), and a three-on-one affair in which Ashley and the guys take wedding photos, and one of the three takes home a red souvenir, guaranteeing him safe passage through the rose ceremony---and a hometown visit from Ashley. Also: 2011 "Bachelor" winner Emily Maynard discusses her relationship with Brad Womack. 8 "Week 8: Hometowns" July 18, 2011 Ashley makes pizza with Constantine in suburban Atlanta, rides in a horse-drawn carriage with Ames outside Philadelphia, picnics with Ben F. in Sonoma, Cal., and roller skates with J.P. on Long Island, N.Y., as she visits the hometowns of her final four bachelors. Returning to the Malibu mansion, she sends one of the guys back home and heads off to Fiji with the other three. 9 "Week 9: Fiji" July 25, 2011 Ashley and her three remaining suitors visit Fiji for daytime frolicking and, perhaps, overnight canoodling. Adventures include sailing and snorkeling with Ben F., a seaplane ride with J.P., and splashing in a lagoon with Constantine, who has big news. Ashley also receives a surprise visitor before she gives roses to two of the guys. 10 "The Men Tell All" July 31, 2011 Six rejected bachelors, including third-place finisher Constantine, confront Ashley and each other — and comment on the behavior of fellow contestant Bentley—in a forum hosted by Chris Harrison. Also: comments by "Bachelor"-franchise alums Jason Mesnick, Ali Fedotowsky, DeAnna Pappas and Michelle Money; a review of the season; and a preview of the Ben F.-J.P. finale. The other bachelors appearing include Ryan P., Ames, Mickey, William and Jeff. 11 "Finale" August 1, 2011 Season 7 finale: In Fiji, Ashley must choose between Ben F. and J.P., the two final contenders for her heart and, perhaps, her hand. In their "last chance" dates, both guys use the L-word, but one has an edge: the support of Ashley's entire family. Not so for the other: Ashley's sister disapproves of him. 12 "After the Final Rose" August 1, 2011 Ashley recaps the Season 7 finale in Fiji, and tells host Chris Harrison what was going through her mind while she was trying to make her decision. Also appearing are the two finalists (Ben F. and J.P.) and Ashley's sister, Chrystie Hebert-Corns Where are they now?[] Ashley and J.P. got married on December 1, 2012, and their wedding aired as a TV Special on December 16, 2012. They have a son named Fordham Rhys born on September 30, 2014. In May 2016, they announced that they are expecting their second child, a daughter. They welcomed daughter Essex Reese on November 4, 2016. On October 14, 2020, Ashley and JP announced on Instagram that are divorcing and going their separate ways. Blake Julian is married to Holly Durst from the 12th season of The Bachelor whom he met on the 2nd season of Bachelor Pad. The couple welcomed a daughter in 2019, through adoption, named Poppy Marie after seven years of infertility struggles. The Ring[] A $60,000, 3.5-carat ring by Neil Lane, featuring a cushion-cut diamond surrounded by 162 round-cut stones. The 7th season of The Bachelorette premiered on May 23, 2011. The season featured 26-year-old Ashley Hebert, a dental student. Hebert was rejected by Brad Womack on the 15th season of The Bachelor, where she was eliminated in week 9. She ultimately chose J.P.
