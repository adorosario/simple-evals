Witty, provocative, and searching, this lively catalogue of female roles inspired by the movies touches a vital nerve in our culture. Sherman plays and stages all of the roles herself, with an acute eye for costume, setting, and pose - and with uncanny poise. As Andy Warhol said, "She's good enough to be a real actress." In 1995 The Museum of Modern Art purchased the entire series from the artist, preserving the work in its entirety. This book marks the first time that the entire series has been published as a unified work. Sherman has arranged the sequence of the pictures, and has written a personal essay about their making.

Description"Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Stills, a series of black-and-white photographs created between 1977 and 1980, is widely seen as one of the most original and influential achievements in recent art. Witty, provocative, and searching, this lively catalogue of female roles inspired by the movies touches a vital nerve in our culture. Sherman plays and stages all of the roles herself, with an acute eye for costume, setting, and pose - and with uncanny poise. As Andy Warhol said, "She's good enough to be a real actress." In 1995 The Museum of Modern Art purchased the entire series from the artist, preserving the work in its entirety. This book marks the first time that the entire series has been published as a unified work. Sherman has arranged the sequence of the pictures, and has written a personal essay about their making. To the original sixty-nine Film Stills she has also added a seventieth, from a roll of film that for some years was lost."--BOOK JACKET.CopiesLocationCall NumberStatusDue DateCentral Library - Adult Nonfiction - Nonfiction Area779.24 SHERMANChecked OutSeptember 26, 2025Table of ContentsLoading Table Of Contents.ExcerptLoading Excerpt.Author NotesLoading Author Notes.SubjectsLC SubjectsPhotography, Artistic.Photography, Artistic.Sherman, CindyStaged photography -- United States.More DetailsLanguageEnglishNotesGeneral Note"Made between 1977 and 1980, the Untitled Film Stills are here reproduced in their entirety for the first time, in a sequence determined by the artist"--Afterword.Description"Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Stills, a series of black-and-white photographs created between 1977 and 1980, is widely seen as one of the most original and influential achievements in recent art.
