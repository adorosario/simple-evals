Itâs leading question: When faced with a potentially dangerous scenario, what do your instincts tell you to do?The Cannon-Bard theory states that the lower part of the brain, also called the thalamus, controls your experience of emotion. At the same time, the higher part of the brain, also called the cortex, controls the expression of emotion. It is believed that these two parts of the brain react simultaneously. This theory was proposed in the 1920s and early 1930s by Walter B. Cannon and Philip Bard. Itâs also referred to as the âfight or flightâ response.Impact of Fight or Flight on Your HealthStress begins in your brain and your senses communicate potential dangers to it. For example, you may see a car coming toward you or hear a sudden loud sound. The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that your amygdala processes what you see and hear, translating possible danger to the hypothalamus.Your amygdala processes emotions. When it communicates potential danger, your brain has a stress response to stay and fight the danger or run away.

For example, your boss at work asks you to come into their office. You immediately think something is wrong, and it triggers your glands to release adrenaline. You become defensive and may feel the need to walk into the office with your guard up, ready to fight. Alternately, past trauma or PTSD can elicit a fight or flight response. Your memories are often grounded in your senses. You remember what you saw, felt, and heard at a particular time. If you see or hear something that reminds you of a traumatic experience, your brain may trigger the fight or flight response.This happens in an effort of self-preservation to protect you from the same trauma again.
