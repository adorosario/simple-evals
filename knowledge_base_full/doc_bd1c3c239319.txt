Alexander Dyce; Formerly in the collection of the Earls Spencer (Lugt 1531).This drawing came to the museum as part of an album containing drawings and engravings chiefly by Thornhill. The album was dismantled and the works remounted.The 1st Duke and Duchess of Marlborough commissioned Thornhill to decorate the interiors of Blenheim Palace. He submitted an estimate of Â£1400 (roughly Â£345,000 today) to paint the great hall, gallery and saloon. This sketch is his second proposal for the design of the hall and is an allegorical celebration of the Duke's military successes in the the War of the Spanish Succession. The British museum holds another drawing for this commission (1949,0411.56) as does the The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens, Sir Bruce Ingram Collection (63.52.258). By the time Thornhill had completed his work in the hall, the costs had grown so dramatically that the Duchess dismissed him and employed the French painter Louis Laguerre to complete the remaining work in the palace at a much reduced cost.Subjects depictedCeilingsGlobeAngelsMarsFameBritanniaMarlborough, John Churchill (1st Duke Of)Anne (Queen)SummaryThis drawing is a design for the painted ceiling in the Great Hall at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, commissioned by the 1st Duke and Duchess of Marlborough.
