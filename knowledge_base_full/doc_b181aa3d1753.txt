La Follette had held this seat since 1983. During his time in office, the powers of the Secretary of State's office had been reduced by the Wisconsin Legislature.[7] Both Republican primary candidates, Bradley and State Representative Garey Bies, argued that the office had become ceremonial and that the current state was unacceptable. While Bies wanted to eliminate the office and give its remaining powers to other agencies, Bradley's platform was to reform the office and regain its former powers.[7][8] 2010 See also: Wisconsin State Assembly elections, 2010 Julian Bradley was defeated by Republican Nick Charles in the primary election.[9] Wisconsin State Assembly, District 95 Republican Primary (2010) Candidates Votes Percent Nick Charles (R) 1,431 54.14% Julian Bradley (R) 1,209 45.74% Campaign themes 2024 Ballotpedia survey responsesSee also: Ballotpedia's Candidate ConnectionJulian Bradley did not complete Ballotpedia's 2024 Candidate Connection survey. 2020 Julian Bradley did not complete Ballotpedia's 2020 Candidate Connection survey. 2016 Bradley's campaign website highlighted the following issues:[10] “ Education: He knows that a good public education is the foundation for a lifetime of success. That is why he supports incentives that will attract teachers to our schools. He'll support technical education and work to keep tuition low, giving working families the break they need. Public safety: The heroin epidemic and sex trafficking are two serious issues that are ravaging our country, and our community has not been exempt from their negative impact. Julian supports legislation such as the H.O.P.E. package which enables victims to get the treatment they need while empowering our community to fight back. Jobs: Julian knows that Western Wisconsin is a great place to live, work, and grow. Our area has the talent and potential needed to attract new jobs. Tech companies are expanding outside of the Silicon Valley and into smaller communities that are being dubbed "Silicon Prairie." Julian will take steps to ensure that our region is ready to take advantage. Transportation: Roads and bridges are the backbone of our economy, and our Western Wisconsin roads deserve the same care and attention that those in other parts of the state receive. Julian will be our voice at the table, and he’ll work to break up the monopoly that Madison and Milwaukee have had on state resources. Taxes: Property taxes today are lower than they were 6 years ago. With homeownership being an integral part to many Wisconsinites’ American Dream, Julian will work to keep reducing property taxes. This helps keep senior citizens on a fixed income in the home they spent a lifetime creating, and allows young families the opportunity to achieve a major goal.[11] ” 2014 Bradley's campaign website listed the following themes for the 2014 election: “ For over 30 years, Doug La Follette has occupied the office of Secretary of State. Under his absentee administration many of the duties of the office have been stripped away. Julian has a different vision for the office to make it work for the people of Wisconsin: Julian will reform the position by running an active and transparent office. He’ll restore the office by not only returning duties to the position, but by restoring faith in it as well. Julian will rebuild the bridges burned over 30 years of Doug La Follette’s absentee administration by once again developing a working relationship with the state’s legislature and executive branch. Julian believes the only thing that should be removed from the Secretary of State’s office is Doug La Follette. Together, we can ensure the responsibilities once entrusted to the Secretary of State are restored to someone who will earn that trust and be a vigorous voice for Wisconsin.

The winner of the Republican nomination needed the support of 1,237 delegates. Trump formally won the nomination on July 19, 2016. Delegate rules See also: RNC delegate guidelines from Wisconsin, 2016 and Republican delegates from Wisconsin, 2016 At-large delegates from Wisconsin to the Republican National Convention were selected by a committee formed by the candidate who received a plurality of the statewide vote in the state presidential primary election and ratified by the State Executive Committee. For district-level delegates, the district chairman of each district compiled a list of delegates from which the presidential candidate who won a plurality of the vote in that district selected three delegates. Delegates from Wisconsin were bound to a candidate on all ballots at the convention unless the candidate released them or failed to receive one-third of the vote on a ballot.

Of this total, 24 were district-level delegates (three for each of the state's eight congressional districts). District delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis; the candidate who won a plurality of the vote in a congressional district received all of that district's delegates.[14][15] Of the remaining 18 delegates, 15 served at large. Wisconsin's at-large delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis. The candidate who won a plurality of the statewide vote received all of the state's at-large delegates. In addition, three national party leaders (identified on the chart below as RNC delegates) served as bound delegates to the Republican National Convention.[14][15] Scorecards See also: State legislative scorecards and State legislative scorecards in Wisconsin A scorecard evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.

That is why he supports incentives that will attract teachers to our schools. He'll support technical education and work to keep tuition low, giving working families the break they need. Public safety: The heroin epidemic and sex trafficking are two serious issues that are ravaging our country, and our community has not been exempt from their negative impact. Julian supports legislation such as the H.O.P.E. package which enables victims to get the treatment they need while empowering our community to fight back. Jobs: Julian knows that Western Wisconsin is a great place to live, work, and grow. Our area has the talent and potential needed to attract new jobs. Tech companies are expanding outside of the Silicon Valley and into smaller communities that are being dubbed "Silicon Prairie." Julian will take steps to ensure that our region is ready to take advantage. Transportation: Roads and bridges are the backbone of our economy, and our Western Wisconsin roads deserve the same care and attention that those in other parts of the state receive. Julian will be our voice at the table, and he’ll work to break up the monopoly that Madison and Milwaukee have had on state resources. Taxes: Property taxes today are lower than they were 6 years ago. With homeownership being an integral part to many Wisconsinites’ American Dream, Julian will work to keep reducing property taxes. This helps keep senior citizens on a fixed income in the home they spent a lifetime creating, and allows young families the opportunity to achieve a major goal.[11] ” 2014 Bradley's campaign website listed the following themes for the 2014 election: “ For over 30 years, Doug La Follette has occupied the office of Secretary of State. Under his absentee administration many of the duties of the office have been stripped away. Julian has a different vision for the office to make it work for the people of Wisconsin: Julian will reform the position by running an active and transparent office. He’ll restore the office by not only returning duties to the position, but by restoring faith in it as well. Julian will rebuild the bridges burned over 30 years of Doug La Follette’s absentee administration by once again developing a working relationship with the state’s legislature and executive branch. Julian believes the only thing that should be removed from the Secretary of State’s office is Doug La Follette. Together, we can ensure the responsibilities once entrusted to the Secretary of State are restored to someone who will earn that trust and be a vigorous voice for Wisconsin.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.

Julian will be our voice at the table, and he’ll work to break up the monopoly that Madison and Milwaukee have had on state resources. Taxes: Property taxes today are lower than they were 6 years ago. With homeownership being an integral part to many Wisconsinites’ American Dream, Julian will work to keep reducing property taxes. This helps keep senior citizens on a fixed income in the home they spent a lifetime creating, and allows young families the opportunity to achieve a major goal.[11] ” 2014 Bradley's campaign website listed the following themes for the 2014 election: “ For over 30 years, Doug La Follette has occupied the office of Secretary of State. Under his absentee administration many of the duties of the office have been stripped away. Julian has a different vision for the office to make it work for the people of Wisconsin: Julian will reform the position by running an active and transparent office. He’ll restore the office by not only returning duties to the position, but by restoring faith in it as well. Julian will rebuild the bridges burned over 30 years of Doug La Follette’s absentee administration by once again developing a working relationship with the state’s legislature and executive branch. Julian believes the only thing that should be removed from the Secretary of State’s office is Doug La Follette. Together, we can ensure the responsibilities once entrusted to the Secretary of State are restored to someone who will earn that trust and be a vigorous voice for Wisconsin.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.

Read more » Bradley ran for election to the office of Wisconsin Secretary of State. He won the Republican nomination in the primary on August 12. The general election took place on November 4, 2014. Primary results General election Race background Incumbent Democrat Doug La Follette faced Republican challenger Julian Bradley and two third-party candidates, Constitution Party candidate Jerry Broitzman and Libertarian Party candidate Andy Craig, in the general election for Wisconsin Secretary of State. La Follette had held this seat since 1983. During his time in office, the powers of the Secretary of State's office had been reduced by the Wisconsin Legislature.[7] Both Republican primary candidates, Bradley and State Representative Garey Bies, argued that the office had become ceremonial and that the current state was unacceptable. While Bies wanted to eliminate the office and give its remaining powers to other agencies, Bradley's platform was to reform the office and regain its former powers.[7][8] Julian Bradley was defeated by Republican Nick Charles in the primary election.[9] Campaign themes Ballotpedia survey responses See also: Ballotpedia's Candidate Connection Julian Bradley did not complete Ballotpedia's 2024 Candidate Connection survey. Julian Bradley did not complete Ballotpedia's 2020 Candidate Connection survey. Bradley's campaign website highlighted the following issues:[10] Education: He knows that a good public education is the foundation for a lifetime of success. That is why he supports incentives that will attract teachers to our schools. He'll support technical education and work to keep tuition low, giving working families the break they need. Public safety: The heroin epidemic and sex trafficking are two serious issues that are ravaging our country, and our community has not been exempt from their negative impact. Julian supports legislation such as the H.O.P.E. package which enables victims to get the treatment they need while empowering our community to fight back. Jobs: Julian knows that Western Wisconsin is a great place to live, work, and grow. Our area has the talent and potential needed to attract new jobs. Tech companies are expanding outside of the Silicon Valley and into smaller communities that are being dubbed "Silicon Prairie." Julian will take steps to ensure that our region is ready to take advantage. Transportation: Roads and bridges are the backbone of our economy, and our Western Wisconsin roads deserve the same care and attention that those in other parts of the state receive. Julian will be our voice at the table, and he’ll work to break up the monopoly that Madison and Milwaukee have had on state resources. Taxes: Property taxes today are lower than they were 6 years ago. With homeownership being an integral part to many Wisconsinites’ American Dream, Julian will work to keep reducing property taxes. This helps keep senior citizens on a fixed income in the home they spent a lifetime creating, and allows young families the opportunity to achieve a major goal.[11] Bradley's campaign website listed the following themes for the 2014 election: For over 30 years, Doug La Follette has occupied the office of Secretary of State. Under his absentee administration many of the duties of the office have been stripped away. Julian has a different vision for the office to make it work for the people of Wisconsin: Julian will reform the position by running an active and transparent office. He’ll restore the office by not only returning duties to the position, but by restoring faith in it as well. Julian will rebuild the bridges burned over 30 years of Doug La Follette’s absentee administration by once again developing a working relationship with the state’s legislature and executive branch. Julian believes the only thing that should be removed from the Secretary of State’s office is Doug La Follette. Together, we can ensure the responsibilities once entrusted to the Secretary of State are restored to someone who will earn that trust and be a vigorous voice for Wisconsin.

Bradley was one of six delegates from Wisconsin bound by state party rules to support Donald Trump at the convention.[13] As of July 13, 2016, Trump had approximately 1,542 delegates. The winner of the Republican nomination needed the support of 1,237 delegates. Trump formally won the nomination on July 19, 2016. Delegate rules At-large delegates from Wisconsin to the Republican National Convention were selected by a committee formed by the candidate who received a plurality of the statewide vote in the state presidential primary election and ratified by the State Executive Committee. For district-level delegates, the district chairman of each district compiled a list of delegates from which the presidential candidate who won a plurality of the vote in that district selected three delegates. Delegates from Wisconsin were bound to a candidate on all ballots at the convention unless the candidate released them or failed to receive one-third of the vote on a ballot. Wisconsin primary results Delegate allocation Wisconsin had 42 delegates at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Of this total, 24 were district-level delegates (three for each of the state's eight congressional districts). District delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis; the candidate who won a plurality of the vote in a congressional district received all of that district's delegates.[14][15] Of the remaining 18 delegates, 15 served at large. Wisconsin's at-large delegates were allocated on a winner-take-all basis. The candidate who won a plurality of the statewide vote received all of the state's at-large delegates. In addition, three national party leaders (identified on the chart below as RNC delegates) served as bound delegates to the Republican National Convention.[14][15] A scorecard evaluates a legislator’s voting record. Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety. Ballotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards. Some states have a limited number of available scorecards or scorecards produced only by select groups. It is Ballotpedia’s goal to incorporate all available scorecards regardless of ideology or number. Click here for an overview of legislative scorecards in all 50 states.
