================================================================================

Shenandoah National Park is pleased to announce Pennsylvania-based photographer Sandy Long, as the artist selected for the Park’s inaugural Artist-in-Residence program. “We are very excited to debut the Artist-in-Residence program in Shenandoah. This program is a great avenue that will allow artists to discover, reveal, and share Shenandoah’s wonderful natural and cultural resources with new audiences,” said Superintendent Jim Northup. Sandy has a multifaceted background as an artist, writer, and educator. Sandy gained her devout appreciation for Wilderness during visits to iconic landscapes which she notes, “have inspired my work as an advocate for wilderness and opportunities that allow people to interface with it.” During the two-week residency, Sandy will embark in explorations that will allow her to capture Shenandoah’s Wilderness from an artist’s perspective. In addition, the visiting public is invited to join Sandy Long, Shenandoah’s Artist-in-Residence, and a park ranger on a casual exploration of the Big Meadows area to discover Wilderness through photography and the senses. This 2-hour program with a 1 to 2 mile easy hike will meet at the Byrd Visitor Center at 1:30 p.m. on September 27, 2014. Saturday, September 27 is Public Lands Day so entrance to Shenandoah is free. Participants are encouraged to bring a camera to aid in their exploration of Big Meadows. This program is geared for all ages. You can obtain Artist –in-Residence program information online from our park website at http://www.nps.gov/shen/supportyourpark/artist-in-residence.htm.
