About 24 May 2022 – (NOTE) This website site is not particularly up to date. However, please check the date against any posts in terms of its relevancy. Clyde Pinelands Associated Football Club (CPAFC) is the oldest non-amalgamated football club in South Africa having been formed in 1898, making us 121 years old to date. According to our records, our club was formed by a Scotsman named Daddy McCloud who was a member of either Clyde FC or Clydebank FC in Scotland. Since the birth of our club, our colours have remained maroon and white with a touch of gold. The club has managed to win every amateur title that there is in the Western Province as well as the National Club Championships – twice in the 1970’s! We have made it to the quarter finals of the South African equivalent of the “FA Cup” on two occasions. We currently have an ex-member in the South African National team and have produced numerous international players including the likes of Stewart Leary. When Cape Town City FC was formed in 1961, four members of Clyde were drafted into that team that was at the time, owned by Western Province. Cape Town City FC, under the prolific management of Englishman Frank Lord, went on to becoming one of the most dominant teams in South Africa, winning every national title available. Many of our members have gone on to play pro football in Europe for clubs such as Stoke City, SV Hamburg, Benfica and in the 1950’s we were an “unofficial feeder“ team for Charlton Athletic with no less than three Clyde boys playing for them at one time. We also supplied New York Cosmos with their first coach, Eddie Firmani who coached the likes of Pele, Johan Cruyff, Jomo Sono and Franz Beckenbaur while there. We also supplied the Captain for the SA Universities team that toured South America in the 1970’s playing 9 games, winning them all without conceding a goal. Household names like Gary France, Glen Jordons, Edwin Sauls, Clive Daries, Mike Brown, Alan Welsh, Rory Farrell, The Rosslee brothers, Sandy Alan, Colin Gie, Donald Gie, Barry Thomas, Mornay Pillay, the four Bywater brothers but to name a few, have all donned the Clyde colours over the years. As it is expected, the club went through a number of transitions crossing the racial lines on many occasions for the love of the game. At present the club serves all socio economic groups, all racial facets and both genders. We have put the love of soccer above colour, wealth and neighbourhood and we will continue to do so for eternity.
