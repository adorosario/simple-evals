Name changes from the Asian version, if any, will appear in parentheses. Damage: The Damage stat dictates how much damage the weapon does. The Damage stats for a weapon are X / Y / Z: X is Physical Damage Y is Magical Damage Z is Fire Damage Bleed, Poison and Plague are bonus damage over a period of 60 seconds. So, if a weapon has "Bleed 120", the victim will suffer 120 damage over 60 seconds, or 2 damage per second. Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Normal Blunt Slashing Piercing Certain enemies are weak or strong against different types of damage types. Durability: The durability of the weapon. The effectiveness of the weapon will severely deteriorate when the durability falls below 30%. Weight: The Weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 50% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The Requirement stats for an weapon are W / X / Y / Z: W is the Strength required X is the Dexterity required Y is the Magic required Z is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 50% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 18 Strength can wield a Great Axe (Requires 26 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (18 x 1.5 = 27) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). Damage Reduction %: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for a shield are X / Y / Z: X is Physical Damage Y is Magical Damage Z is Fire Damage Guard Break Reduction: The Guard Break Reduction determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher Guard Break Reduction also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Footnotes 1.
