The cylindrical module at the top is a Nauka module. Russian materials science satellite. Adaptation of recoverable Vostok spacecraft for zero-gravity materials processing tests. 400 W available to operate experiments. Micro-gravity satellite built by TsSKB > TsSKB-Progress, Russia. Launched 1985 - 1999. Status: Operational 1985. First Launch: 1985-04-16. Last Launch: 2007-09-14. Number: 15 . Payload: 404 kg (890 lb). Gross mass: 6,190 kg (13,640 lb). Beginning in 1985 the USSR/CIS conducted annual unmanned space missions dedicated to materials science research. The Foton spacecraft used for these flights was a derivative of the 1960's era Vostok/Voskhod manned spacecraft and the Zenit military reconnaissance satellites and was very similar to the Bion and Resurs-F satellites. Prototype Foton satellites were launched as Cosmos 1645, 1744, and 1841. Since 1988 the spacecraft were officially designated as Foton. The 6200 kg spacecraft was 6.2 m in length with a maximum diameter of 2.5 m and was divided into three major sections: the service/retro module, the payload capsule, and an equipment block. The 2.3-m diameter recoverable capsule could handle a payload of up to 700 kg and a volume of 4.7 m3. Electrical power was supplied entirely by storage batteries with 400 W average per day allocated to the payload (up to 700 W for 90 minutes each day). Mission durations for the eight Foton flights to the end of 1992 were 13-16 days. To minimize perturbation forces, thereby maximizing microgravity conditions (as low as 10^-5 g), Foton spacecraft were placed in mildly eccentric orbits at 62.8 degrees inclination and were not maneuvered during the mission.Prior to 1991 annual Foton missions were always launched in April or May. Launches were performed by the Soyuz booster from Plesetsk, and recoveries were made in Kazakhstan in the primary manned recovery region north-east of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Foton spacecraft had flown with the Zona 1, Zona 4, Zona 4M, Splav 2, and Konstanta 2 electric furnaces as well as the Kashtan electrophoresis unit. The French firm Carra was developing a new interface module for Foton called Spacepack in 1994, which would facilitate the integration of foreign microgravity experiments on Russian spacecraft like Foton.

For this mission a 385 kg European payload of 39 experiments in fluid physics, biology, material science, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology was carried. A further 215 kg of Russian instruments were also flown. Many were experiments were being reflown following loss of Foton-M1 on 15 October 2002.

The Foton spacecraft used for these flights was a derivative of the 1960's era Vostok/Voskhod manned spacecraft and the Zenit military reconnaissance satellites and was very similar to the Bion and Resurs-F satellites. Prototype Foton satellites were launched as Cosmos 1645, 1744, and 1841. Since 1988 the spacecraft were officially designated as Foton. The 6200 kg spacecraft was 6.2 m in length with a maximum diameter of 2.5 m and was divided into three major sections: the service/retro module, the payload capsule, and an equipment block. The 2.3-m diameter recoverable capsule could handle a payload of up to 700 kg and a volume of 4.7 m3. Electrical power was supplied entirely by storage batteries with 400 W average per day allocated to the payload (up to 700 W for 90 minutes each day). Mission durations for the eight Foton flights to the end of 1992 were 13-16 days. To minimize perturbation forces, thereby maximizing microgravity conditions (as low as 10^-5 g), Foton spacecraft were placed in mildly eccentric orbits at 62.8 degrees inclination and were not maneuvered during the mission.Prior to 1991 annual Foton missions were always launched in April or May. Launches were performed by the Soyuz booster from Plesetsk, and recoveries were made in Kazakhstan in the primary manned recovery region north-east of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Foton spacecraft had flown with the Zona 1, Zona 4, Zona 4M, Splav 2, and Konstanta 2 electric furnaces as well as the Kashtan electrophoresis unit. The French firm Carra was developing a new interface module for Foton called Spacepack in 1994, which would facilitate the integration of foreign microgravity experiments on Russian spacecraft like Foton.

Microgravity mission with the experiments being returned to earth after 16 days in a spherical Vostok capsule of the type that first carried Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. The capsule landed in Kazakhstan at 07:36 GMT on 16 June. For this mission a 385 kg European payload of 39 experiments in fluid physics, biology, material science, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology was carried. A further 215 kg of Russian instruments were also flown. Many were experiments were being reflown following loss of Foton-M1 on 15 October 2002. The planned Fotino miniature re-entry capsule experiment was not flown. Applied research included heat transfer experiments with the European FluidPac facility, chemical diffusion experiments in the SCCO (Soret Coefficients in Crude Oil), and material science investigations in the Agat and Polizon furnaces. These experiments were expected to contribute to new heat-exchanger designs, more efficient oil exploration processes, and better semiconductor alloys.

Launches were performed by the Soyuz booster from Plesetsk, and recoveries were made in Kazakhstan in the primary manned recovery region north-east of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Foton spacecraft had flown with the Zona 1, Zona 4, Zona 4M, Splav 2, and Konstanta 2 electric furnaces as well as the Kashtan electrophoresis unit. The French firm Carra was developing a new interface module for Foton called Spacepack in 1994, which would facilitate the integration of foreign microgravity experiments on Russian spacecraft like Foton.

Microgravity mission with the experiments being returned to earth after 16 days in a spherical Vostok capsule of the type that first carried Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. The capsule landed in Kazakhstan at 07:36 GMT on 16 June. For this mission a 385 kg European payload of 39 experiments in fluid physics, biology, material science, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology was carried. A further 215 kg of Russian instruments were also flown. Many were experiments were being reflown following loss of Foton-M1 on 15 October 2002. The planned Fotino miniature re-entry capsule experiment was not flown. Applied research included heat transfer experiments with the European FluidPac facility, chemical diffusion experiments in the SCCO (Soret Coefficients in Crude Oil), and material science investigations in the Agat and Polizon furnaces. These experiments were expected to contribute to new heat-exchanger designs, more efficient oil exploration processes, and better semiconductor alloys. The Biopan facility carried life science experiments, including a student seed germination test. 2007 September 14 - . 11:00 GMT - . Launch Site: Baikonur. Launch Complex: Baikonur LC1.

Launches were performed by the Soyuz booster from Plesetsk, and recoveries were made in Kazakhstan in the primary manned recovery region north-east of the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Foton spacecraft had flown with the Zona 1, Zona 4, Zona 4M, Splav 2, and Konstanta 2 electric furnaces as well as the Kashtan electrophoresis unit. The French firm Carra was developing a new interface module for Foton called Spacepack in 1994, which would facilitate the integration of foreign microgravity experiments on Russian spacecraft like Foton.

Microgravity mission with the experiments being returned to earth after 16 days in a spherical Vostok capsule of the type that first carried Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961. The capsule landed in Kazakhstan at 07:36 GMT on 16 June. For this mission a 385 kg European payload of 39 experiments in fluid physics, biology, material science, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology was carried. A further 215 kg of Russian instruments were also flown. Many were experiments were being reflown following loss of Foton-M1 on 15 October 2002. The planned Fotino miniature re-entry capsule experiment was not flown. Applied research included heat transfer experiments with the European FluidPac facility, chemical diffusion experiments in the SCCO (Soret Coefficients in Crude Oil), and material science investigations in the Agat and Polizon furnaces. These experiments were expected to contribute to new heat-exchanger designs, more efficient oil exploration processes, and better semiconductor alloys. The Biopan facility carried life science experiments, including a student seed germination test.
