wall-unit braun wall unit braun wall unit The abso­lu­te cult object. The wall-moun­ted system is one of the most sought-after hi-fi sys­tems from the 60s. The combi­nation of the ampli­fier part with radio, the reel to reel machi­ne, the matching spea­k­ers and the record player on a Vitsoe shelf is a great idea of the designer Dieter Rams. The Braun hi-fi wall unit is an object of desire for enthu­si­a­stic Braun coll­ec­tors. This abso­lu­te rarity is rarely offe­red as a com­ple­te system, and when it is, it is in poor con­di­ti­on or half­way to hit­ting the right color tone repain­ted and reprin­ted.

Short­wa­ve, Medi­um­wa­ve and Longwa­ve are accom­pa­nied by a fm stereo sec­tion. When con­nec­ted to an anten­na, the qua­li­ty of the radio recep­tion is great. There is a field inten­si­ty dis­play and a stereo indi­ca­tor lamp, which give the FM sec­tion a com­ple­te look. The TS 45 is equip­ped with sus­pen­si­on devices for wall moun­ting and is tech­ni­cal­ly abso­lut­e­ly iden­ti­cal in con­s­truc­tion to the audio 2 com­pact system also laun­ched in 1965. The TS 45 was sold for 1,245.00 Deutsche Mark. The ampli­fier power is 2 x 15 watts (sine 2 x 25 watt).

TG 60 reel-to-reel tape recorder The braun TG 60 tape recor­der was desi­gned by Dieter Rams in 1965. The tech­ni­cal imple­men­ta­ti­on of the requi­re­ments was car­ri­ed out by the engi­neer Wolf­gang Has­sel­bach. Equip­ped with 3 Pabst elec­tric motors, the reel-to-reel machi­ne can be ope­ra­ted easily, quick­ly and relia­bly. The TG 60 is spe­ci­al­ly cali­bra­ted for the Braun (BASF) TB 631 tape. The 18 cm reel can play back about 45 minu­tes of stereo recor­dings at a speed of 19cm/s. Three sepa­ra­te half-track heads for era­sing, recor­ding and play­back allow back-tape con­trol of the recor­ding, as it was only common in highly pro­fes­sio­nal studio tape recor­ders from Revox and Studer at that time. The TG 60 was a per­fect match for the TS 45 and the L 450 loud­spea­k­ers. The retail price in 1965 was quite a proud 1,995.00 German marks. Maybe that’s why only a total of 500 units were produced.

L 450 speaker The Braun L 450 spea­k­ers are the ori­gi­nal models for the legen­da­ry wall-moun­ted system. These spea­k­ers were spe­ci­al­ly desi­gned in 1965 to match the TS 45 and the Audio 2 com­pact system. They were made in white, gra­phi­te and walnut veneer. They are equip­ped with a 5,1 inch woofer and a 1,3 inch high range loud­spea­k­er, tran­si­ti­on fre­quen­cy at 2,600 Hz, power rating 20 watt at 4 ohm, the fre­quen­cy range goes from 35–25000 Hz, size w 18,5 x h 9,8 x d 4,1 inches. These wall spea­k­ers were sold at that time per piece for 298,- German Mark. From 1969, the spea­k­er model L 470 repla­ced the L 450. The L 470 was pro­vi­ded with a dome for the high-fre­quen­cy range and other­wi­se the same dimen­si­ons and can the­r­e­fo­re also be used abso­lut­e­ly sui­ta­ble in the Braun stereo wall system.

PCS 5 turntable The ori­gi­nal braun turn­ta­ble model PCS 5 is an impres­si­ve piece of craft­sman­ship. The tone­arm has ela­bo­ra­te adjus­t­ment opti­ons for per­fect record play­back com­fort and was equip­ped with a tone­arm lift for manual ope­ra­ti­on. A Shure pickup was used in the tone head at the fac­to­ry, and its need­les can still be reor­de­red today. Tech­ni­cal main­ten­an­ce in a qua­li­fied work­shop ensu­res that the PCS 5 turn­ta­ble will func­tion as it did on the first day, and will con­ti­nue to do so for deca­des to come. This record player was sold from 1965 for 658,- German Mark. PCS 5 turntable The ori­gi­nal braun turn­ta­ble model PCS 5 is an impres­si­ve piece of craft­sman­ship.

Braunau­dio vintage means, that the tech­ni­cal func­tions are res­to­red and that the appearance is the careful­ly res­to­red ori­gi­nal finish. You will recei­ve a detail­ed docu­men­ta­ti­on of the repair work per­for­med and an ori­gi­nal braun audio vintage cer­ti­fi­ca­ti­on of the respec­ti­ve con­di­ti­on. The wall-unit is available in white and also in the gray color known as graphite. The per­fect assem­bly of the system with the Vitsoe rail system and the shelf dra­wers shor­ten­ed to the right dimen­si­ons crea­tes exact­ly the image that makes the wall system attrac­ti­ve. A fully func­tio­ning wall system should not be spoi­led by visi­ble con­nec­ting cables. The ela­bo­ra­te wiring of this stereo wall unit from 1965 requi­res some modi­fi­ca­ti­ons. Cable chan­nels are set up on the Vitsoe E‑profiles and the spe­ci­al­ly made sus­pen­si­on rails for the L450 loud­spea­k­ers, the TS 45 con­trol unit and the very heavy TG 60 tape recor­der. In this way, the cabling can be made largely invi­si­ble. As an alter­na­ti­ve to the TG 60 tape recor­der, the impro­ved suc­ces­sor models TG 502 or TG 504 are also available for purcha­se, as are the L 470 loud­spea­k­er models as an alter­na­ti­ve to the L 450 loudspeakers. historic development historic development Hi-Fi Wall Units by Braun.

TG 60 reel-to-reel tape recorder The braun TG 60 tape recor­der was desi­gned by Dieter Rams in 1965. The tech­ni­cal imple­men­ta­ti­on of the requi­re­ments was car­ri­ed out by the engi­neer Wolf­gang Has­sel­bach. Equip­ped with 3 Pabst elec­tric motors, the reel-to-reel machi­ne can be ope­ra­ted easily, quick­ly and relia­bly. The TG 60 is spe­ci­al­ly cali­bra­ted for the Braun (BASF) TB 631 tape. The 18 cm reel can play back about 45 minu­tes of stereo recor­dings at a speed of 19cm/s. Three sepa­ra­te half-track heads for era­sing, recor­ding and play­back allow back-tape con­trol of the recor­ding, as it was only common in highly pro­fes­sio­nal studio tape recor­ders from Revox and Studer at that time. The TG 60 was a per­fect match for the TS 45 and the L 450 loud­spea­k­ers. The retail price in 1965 was quite a proud 1,995.00 German marks. Maybe that’s why only a total of 500 units were produced.

Braunau­dio vintage means, that the tech­ni­cal func­tions are res­to­red and that the appearance is the careful­ly res­to­red ori­gi­nal finish. You will recei­ve a detail­ed docu­men­ta­ti­on of the repair work per­for­med and an ori­gi­nal braun audio vintage cer­ti­fi­ca­ti­on of the respec­ti­ve con­di­ti­on.
