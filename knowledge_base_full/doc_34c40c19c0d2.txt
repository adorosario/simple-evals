Oil on canvas. 54.5 × 66 cm. National Museum, Oslo, Norway. Image source (open access)This Edvard Munch painting, titled The Girls on the Bridge, takes us directly into those crepuscular Nordic summer nights, when the sun never quite sets but skims the horizon before lifting again for the next day.I’ve only seen a handful of Munch’s paintings in real life. Of those, one aspect that always strikes me is how the surfaces are made up of such thin and loosely handled paint. You can feel the brisk movements the artist must have made with his brush.The texture becomes like a river flow, weaving in great currents around the canvas — brooding and brimming like a swollen river about to break its banks.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeDetail of ‘The Girls on the Bridge’ (1901) by Edvard Munch.

Image source (open access)You only need to look at the smeared form of the bridge in this painting, or the spooling depth of the black water into which the three girls gaze.It’s such a mystifying thing, since the paint feels insubstantial at close quarters, but when you step back it breathes and pulsates, coagulating into objects and people rather than simply depicting them.
