For the memorial of oka kiyoshi's work, there openedhttp://w3rep.math.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/topicse.html Gossips and Rumors among Japanese Mathematicians. Prof. Peter Slodowy died last November (2002/11). May his soul rest in peace. [Tue Mar 18 16:31:41 JST 2003] 2001 MSJ Awards of Algebra went to Tamotsu Ikeda (Kyoto Univ.) and Toshiaki Shoji (Science Univ. Tokyo). Congratulations!! Yasuyuki Kawahigashi won the first award of operator algebra also. [Tue Apr 3 14:37:30 JST 2001] Li-Paul-Tan-Zhu Langlands parameter (for p + q <= n ). This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years. It will become more comprehensive (^^;;) and the contents will be upgraded to certain extent. 4.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

May his soul rest in peace. [Tue Mar 18 16:31:41 JST 2003] 2001 MSJ Awards of Algebra went to Tamotsu Ikeda (Kyoto Univ.) and Toshiaki Shoji (Science Univ. Tokyo). Congratulations!! Yasuyuki Kawahigashi won the first award of operator algebra also. [Tue Apr 3 14:37:30 JST 2001] Li-Paul-Tan-Zhu Langlands parameter (for p + q <= n ). This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years. It will become more comprehensive (^^;;) and the contents will be upgraded to certain extent. 4.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 3.

May his soul rest in peace. [Tue Mar 18 16:31:41 JST 2003] 2001 MSJ Awards of Algebra went to Tamotsu Ikeda (Kyoto Univ.) and Toshiaki Shoji (Science Univ. Tokyo). Congratulations!! Yasuyuki Kawahigashi won the first award of operator algebra also. [Tue Apr 3 14:37:30 JST 2001] Li-Paul-Tan-Zhu Langlands parameter (for p + q <= n ). This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years. It will become more comprehensive (^^;;) and the contents will be upgraded to certain extent. 4.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

May his soul rest in peace. [Tue Mar 18 16:31:41 JST 2003] 2001 MSJ Awards of Algebra went to Tamotsu Ikeda (Kyoto Univ.) and Toshiaki Shoji (Science Univ. Tokyo). Congratulations!! Yasuyuki Kawahigashi won the first award of operator algebra also. [Tue Apr 3 14:37:30 JST 2001] Li-Paul-Tan-Zhu Langlands parameter (for p + q <= n ). This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years. It will become more comprehensive (^^;;) and the contents will be upgraded to certain extent. 4.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

May his soul rest in peace. [Tue Mar 18 16:31:41 JST 2003] 2001 MSJ Awards of Algebra went to Tamotsu Ikeda (Kyoto Univ.) and Toshiaki Shoji (Science Univ. Tokyo). Congratulations!! Yasuyuki Kawahigashi won the first award of operator algebra also. [Tue Apr 3 14:37:30 JST 2001] Li-Paul-Tan-Zhu Langlands parameter (for p + q <= n ). This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years. It will become more comprehensive (^^;;) and the contents will be upgraded to certain extent. 4.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

This is the end of the similar works for type I dual pairs (by Moeglin, Adamas, Barbasch, and Paul) for "equal rank case". Although the description is quite complicated, these works seem to settle the problem of describing explicit theta correspondence considerably. [Fri Dec 8 18:13:47 JST 2000] There is an internatinal conference in honor of Prof. Schiffmann in January, 2001, in Strassbourg. It seems that it will be a very interesting conference, and many Japanese mathematicians will attend it. [Sat Dec 9 22:02:33 JST 2000] Prof. Mukai (Nagoya Univ.) has written two books on moduli theory (or geometric invariant theory) in Japanese. And now it is being translated into English. The contents are full of examples and very fascinating. There is no introductory textbook in geometric invariant theory other than Mumford-Forgaty-Kirwin (if one can call it a textbook). A book for beginners in this field is expected for a long time, to my impression, and now it will soon be available!! [Sat Dec 9 21:55:52 JST 2000] Encyclopedia of Mathematics (edited by MSJ) will be revised (4th edition) in next 4 or 5 years.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Applications Of YAG Laser Processing In Underwater Welding And 5 pp. 256259. Development of Laser Cutting/Welding System for Remote Maintenanceof ITER Manifold. YAMAOKA Hiroto,TSUCHIYA Kazuyuki AWANO Toshihiko,oka kiyoshi.http://www.ihi.co.jp/ihi/technology/gihou/gihou42-5c-e.html Applications of YAG Laser Processing in Underwater Welding and Cutting OWAKI Katsura,MORITA Ichiro KOJIMA Toshio,SATOU Syuichi The high-power YAG laser is a new fabrication tool. The laser torch is easy to combine with complex mechanics because of beam delivery through optical fiber. A direct underwater laser welding technology has been developed and applied to the preservation, maintenance and removal of nuclear power plants. For subdividing or removing operations for retirement of plants, the laser cutting properties were confirmed to allow a maximum cutting thickness of 80 mm. For repairing inner surface of stainless steel tanks, an underwater laser welding system using a remote-controlled robot was developed and the high quality of underwater laser welding was confirmed. Ishikawajima-Harima Engineering Review September 2002 Vol. 42 No. 5 pp. 247-250 Development of Automatic Laser Welding System OWAKI Katsura Lasers are a new production tool for high speed and low distortion welding and applications to automatic welding lines are increasing. IHI has long experience of laser processing for the preservation of nuclear power plants, welding of airplane engines and so on. Moreover, YAG laser oscillators and various kinds of hardware have been developed for laser welding and automation. Combining these welding technologies and laser hardware technologies produce the automatic laser welding system. In this paper, the component technologies are described, including combined optics intended to improve welding stability, laser oscillators, monitoring system, seam tracking system and so on. 11. ÈW2002.3 Have you ever read the beautiful article by oka kiyoshi, who was bornat Wakayama Prefecuture, as I read it when I was 19 yeas old.http://chaokemoto.hp.infoseek.co.jp/mail200203.htm ÈW Date: Sun, 17 Mar 2002 09:51:32 +0900 (JST) Mr.Kaj CC)S.Ha @¡AW¼Å·B¨Íæ¤²´¢Ü·B¡úàtÌDVÉbÜêACªÍÅ·BÆ±ëÅA·ìÌSOAPÌdÍ¡úêtÅ·æËHPcétÍ³êÜµ½©H @NðæÁÄ­éÆAÈñ¾©AÔªäÁ­è¬êÄ¢­æ¤Å·B úq³ê½ªAãYíÈuËðÌñÑèÆiñÅ¢­æ¤È´¶Å·B @à¤AlÍßÄµÜ¢½µ½B w³æÈçAxmÊ³ñAPWNÔ¨¢bÉÈèÜµ½B Å·B @ÅàAlÉàAà¤IÔ ª Á½à¢¢Åµå¤BÈñ½ÁÄAPWNàxmÊÅæêüGWjAÅ¥ÝÆÇÜéÆ¢¤Aµ©àAwå^Rs [^AUnix[NXe[VAFM8,FM16À,FMÎAFM-R, FM-Towns, CXg[fì¬AAvJ­i ¤H@Æ¾Á½çAÈñÅ»ñÈª»éÌ©ÆAq©çYÆXpCÌæ¤ÈÚÅ©çêÜ·BxÌæ¤ÈA£êÆA¿åÁÆwr[Åyµ¢¨dð¡©çv ¦ÎAyX±ÈµÄ«½©çÅ·B å¤jB@±¢ÂçAåÌSOðß¬éÆA_¶ðð·éÌ³¦Ah­ÈéÌÅARs [^É¬êÜ·B·éÆAóÌí©Á½AwEÌål½¿ÍA @w  A ÌlàAÜ½AdqvZ@Æ¢¤ÈPÈ¢EÉ¦°½©AÜÜæx ÆðÌæÉ³êéÌÅ·BÍAãLÌæ¤ÈªAùÉPUÎÌA»ÁÄµÜ¢A µÎç­T·éÆ»Àª©¦Ä­éÌÅ·B @Õbxè æTÌyjúAÐåñÈ©çARyan MiyashiroNiUS IAtogjÆÌç®ç·éÆ¢¤S­ÌôRð¾Üµ½BÞÍAlÌêZÌ¾PÅpêÌâ³tðµÄ¢ÄA¶ÜêÈªçÉµÄpêðb·ÌÅA©ÈèpêÍãèÅ·BÅàApêÌæ¶ÆµÄÌAo±Ís«µÄ¢Ü·BæTÌjúANxÌpêÌâ³ÞÆµÄA 12.

Ester syntheses catalyzed by a lipase have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide. In the near-critical region, the rate showed a sharp maximum and (S)-(-)-terpene esters were stereoselectively synthesized from acyl donors and a primary alcohol. The structure of an enzyme and interactions between carbon dioxide and enzyme molecules have been examined by using in situ FTIR and gravimetry. The alkaline fading of crystal violet (CV) is accelerated by using a W/O microemulsion of H O/AOT/ethane under supercritical conditions. The structure of AOT molecules and the type of interior water molecules may account for the rate enhancement. 13.

Born 19 April 1901 in Osaka, Wakayama Prefecture, Japanhttp://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Oka.html Kiyoshi Oka Born: 19 April 1901 in Osaka, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan Died: 1 March 1978 in Nara, Japan Click the picture above to see a larger version Previous (Chronologically) Next Biographies Index Previous (Alphabetically) Next Main index Kiyoshi Oka entered the Imperial University of Kyoto in 1922 to study physics. However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.

However in 1923 he changed topic to study mathematics, graduating with a degree in mathematics in 1925. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Science at the Imperial University of Kyoto. In 1929 he was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In fact 1929 was a very significant year for Oka for in that year he took sabbatical leave and went to the University of Paris. He became interested in unsolved problems in the theory of functions of several complex variables while working in Paris. The reason that his work took this direction was that in Paris he became acquainted with Julia Oka remained on the staff at the Imperial University of Kyoto while he was on leave in Paris but on his return to Japan in 1932 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the Faculty of Science of Hiroshima University. In 1938 Oka went to Kimitoge in Wakayama where he studied, presented his doctoral thesis to the University of Kyoto in 1940. After obtaining his doctorate, Oka was a research assistant at Hokkaido University during 1941/41, then, with the support of the Huju-kai Foundation under the chairmanship of Takagi, he spent the next seven years again at Kimitoge in Wakayama. 15.
