D Dans70Z20 Member Listed in “Flatheads forever” forum but realized I should have listed it here. Purchased 10 yrs ago for a Bonanza minibike project that I intended to get to but never did. "Released in 1995, the third and final Raptor, the Raptor III, had five horsepower. The only thing different from the II was that this one had a cast-alloy crank with a carbon-infused piston. This engine sold phenomenally, however, and almost phased out its two predecessors. Hundreds of thousands of these engines remain in service today, and are the best-selling racing engine of all time." Specifications: https://www.briggsracing.com/racing-engines/raptor Has never been out of crate. Thinking I may never get to it. Taking offers. I can email pics if needed, but simply put it is in original packaging and has never left the crate except maybe when I first purchased it . I am located in Long Island, NY. email: danrul@msn.com Thanks Dan Last edited: Jan 30, 2021 D Dans70Z20 Member Dans70Z20 Member Listed in “Flatheads forever” forum but realized I should have listed it here.
