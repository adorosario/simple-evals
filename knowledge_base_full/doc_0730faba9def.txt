Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. spell_toolweapon page revision: 79, last edited: 07 Nov 2021 17:05 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. spell_toolweapon page revision: 79, last edited: 07 Nov 2021 17:05 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. spell_toolweapon page revision: 79, last edited: 07 Nov 2021 17:05 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. spell_toolweapon page revision: 79, last edited: 07 Nov 2021 17:05 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. spell_toolweapon page revision: 79, last edited: 07 Nov 2021 17:05 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Spread the Word!

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).

Using the strong attack will cast Sorceries. Can't cast Hexes. Enchanting Blue Flame with Magic Weapon/Great Magic Weapon/Crystal Magic Weapon increases its Magic Damage, which also increases the damage of Sorceries cast with it. It uses more stamina to cast than other Spell Tools, probably due to casts counting as a "strong attack". Like all weapons in the left hand, stamina consumption is higher compared to swings on the right hand. However, unlike staves, the Blue Flame also loses damage on both swings and casts if wielded left-handed. The Blue Flame can be powerstanced, but strong attacking with the left weapon won't cast a spell, it will just use the powerstanced strong attack. If used with a weapon with which it can be powerstance in left hand (including required stats), the followup to an attack with lefthand leads to the r1 being the one of standar straightswords (up right to down left).
