# 1000-Example Comprehensive Audit Plan

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive academic-grade audit plan for analyzing the 1000-example benchmark results. The audit addresses critical methodological gaps and applies rigorous academic standards to validate our RAG provider evaluation framework.

## **Current Status**

### **Background Context**
- **Original Investigation**: Started with suspected CustomGPT underperformance based on "4x higher abstention rate"
- **Critical Discovery**: Original assumptions were WRONG - systematic judge bias was the real issue
- **Bias Corrections Applied**: Implemented structured outputs, blind evaluation, GPT-5 parameter optimization, and 92% prompt reduction
- **100-Example Results**: CustomGPT emerged as top performer (Quality Score 0.56 vs OpenAI RAG 0.29)
- **Current Status**: 1000-example benchmark running in background inside Docker container

### **Technical Infrastructure**
- **Judge System**: GPT-5 with structured JSON schema outputs, seed=42, reasoning_effort="minimal"
- **Evaluation Framework**: OpenAI's penalty-aware scoring with 80% confidence threshold, 4.0 penalty ratio
- **Provider Configuration**: 3 providers (CustomGPT_RAG, OpenAI_RAG, OpenAI_Vanilla) with bias-corrected blind evaluation
- **Audit Logging**: Complete transparency with all requests, responses, and evaluations logged

## **Critical Academic Gaps Identified**

### **1. Inter-Rater Reliability Crisis**
- **Single Judge Problem**: Only GPT-5 as judge - academic standards require multiple independent raters
- **No Human Baseline**: Zero human expert validation of judge decisions
- **No Cross-Validation**: No secondary judge to validate controversial decisions
- **Impact**: Cannot establish judge reliability or validate evaluation quality

### **2. Ground Truth Validation Gap**
- **Assumed Correctness**: Assume SimpleQA "gold targets" are correct without validation
- **No Source Verification**: No verification that target answers are still current/accurate
- **Answer Ambiguity**: Multiple valid answers might exist for some questions
- **Impact**: Evaluation quality depends entirely on unvalidated ground truth

### **3. Statistical Rigor Deficiencies**
- **No Power Analysis**: Haven't calculated if 1000 examples provide sufficient statistical power
- **No Confidence Intervals**: Point estimates without uncertainty quantification
- **No Significance Testing**: No statistical tests for provider performance differences
- **Impact**: Cannot establish statistical significance of performance differences

### **4. Systematic Bias Risks**
- **Question Domain Bias**: SimpleQA might favor certain knowledge domains
- **Temporal Bias**: Questions from different eras might favor different knowledge cutoffs
- **Provider Configuration Bias**: Are providers optimally configured for their strengths?
- **Length/Format Bias**: Do certain answer lengths/formats get systematically different treatment?
- **Impact**: Results might not generalize beyond specific test conditions

### **5. Methodological Transparency Issues**
- **Confidence Score Validation**: How do we validate confidence scores are meaningful?
- **Abstention Strategy Gaming**: Can providers game the system by strategic abstention?
- **RAG Retrieval Quality**: No analysis of retrieval quality for RAG systems
- **Penalty Framework Justification**: Limited validation of 4.0 penalty ratio choice
- **Impact**: Methodology may have unvalidated assumptions affecting results
