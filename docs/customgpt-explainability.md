Verify Responses (previously Explainability) is now available to customers :1397_party-wizardparrot:
New agentic Action with a total added cost of 4 queries
While feature is enabled, all queries are analyzed in depth:
Claims agent made are extracted
Used context is searched to find sources for each claim
Claims are flagged if no source is found
Claims and their status are reviewed from the perspective of six stakeholders: End User, Security IT, Risk Compliance, Legal Compliance, Public Relations, Executive Leadership
Each stakeholder provides assessment and final status is calculated
Analysis can be accessed on Ask page with the new icon - which is visible only to builder on that page
Process is done in the background and end-user is not affected in any way
Claude 4.5 Sonnet is used as other models proved not up to the task
Everything is available via API as well
We are on schedule for Jan 22nd launch, and any real user feedback by then would be amazing
things to do before/after launch:
enable feature on-demand via both API & UI, so users can run it on individual queries if they prefer it that way
add data to Customer Intelligence page as well
incorporate Persona is analysis
calculate numerical score
thanks to @Andrew & @Abdallah Yasser for all the effort and bringing the feature to the finish line!
@Alden Do Rosario you can do your thing now!
