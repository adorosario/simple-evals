**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: September 25, 2025
**Status**: Active Investigation
**Priority**: Critical

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a comprehensive investigation plan to identify and resolve CustomGPT performance issues discovered during benchmark testing. The investigation follows a systematic approach to ensure no root causes are missed and establishes quality assurance protocols to prevent future performance degradation.

## **Current State Analysis**

### Critical Issues Identified
- **DNS Resolution Failures**: Clear evidence of `app.customgpt.ai` DNS failures during the 100-example run
- **Error Masking Bug**: API errors being reported as 0% despite visible network exceptions
- **Performance Gap**: CustomGPT showing lower performance compared to OpenAI RAG
- **Judge Evaluation Issues**: Inconsistent evaluation coverage affecting reliability

### Performance Metrics (Last Run)
- **CustomGPT Results**: Volume=0.82, Quality=0.26, 96% Attempted, 85.4% Success
- **OpenAI RAG Results**: Volume=0.85, Quality=0.29, 99% Attempted, 85.9% Success
- **Abstentions**: CustomGPT=4, OpenAI RAG=1 (4x higher abstention rate)
- **Network Failures**: Multiple DNS resolution errors observed but not properly reported

## **Phase 1: Fresh Clean 100-Example Benchmark (IMMEDIATE)**

### Objectives
- Execute a clean benchmark under stable network conditions
- Validate that error reporting fixes are working correctly
- Establish a reliable baseline for performance analysis

### Tasks
1. **Execute Clean Benchmark Run**
   - Run: `docker compose run --rm simple-evals python scripts/confidence_threshold_benchmark.py --examples 100`
   - Ensure stable network conditions before execution
   - Monitor console output for DNS/network issues in real-time
   - Capture complete audit logs and results

2. **Validate Error Reporting Fixes**
   - Verify API errors are now properly counted (not 0%)
   - Confirm network failures raise exceptions instead of returning empty strings
   - Check that failed requests are excluded from performance metrics
   - Validate error rates appear correctly in HTML reports

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Benchmark completes without hidden API errors
- ✅ All network failures properly reported in error metrics

  - What types of questions does OpenAI RAG attempt vs abstain?
  - Quality difference in borderline cases
- **Classifier Validation**:
  - Review abstention classifier accuracy on CustomGPT responses
  - Check for false negatives (incorrect attempts classified as abstentions)
  - Validate classifier reasoning for CustomGPT-specific patterns

#### 2.2 Judge Evaluation Audit
- **Coverage Analysis**:
  - Cross-reference judge evaluations with provider responses
  - Identify questions where judge evaluation failed or was inconsistent
  - Validate that all CustomGPT responses received proper evaluation

  - Compare judge confidence levels across providers
  - Check for systematic bias in judge evaluations

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Root cause of high abstention rate identified
- ✅ Judge evaluation consistency validated across all providers
