It falls within the City of York Council unitary authority, where it is part of the Rural West York Ward, currently represented by Councillors Anne Hook and James Barker, both members of the Liberal Democrat Group. It sits within the Parliamentary Constituency of York Outer, a seat currently held by local farmer Julian Sturdy (Conservative). The 2011 Census recorded a population of 351 residents. The entire village was designated as a Conservation Area in 1975. The main road through the village, Main Street, boasts a duck pond and village green. There is also an excellent primary school, St Mary’s Church of England School, and the village pub, the Rose & Crown, owned by Samuel Smiths Brewery based in the nearby town of Tadcaster. The most significant building in the village, however, is Askham Grange. This very fine country house, formerly the home of the wealthy Wailes -Fairbairn family, was leased to the War Office for use as a military hospital during the Second World War. In 1946 the decision was taken to open the property as a Women’s Open Prison, a function which continues to this day. Tucked away next to the prison is the Grade II listed St Mary’s Church. The current church was partly re-built in 1887, but there is record of a church on this site since 1086. The neighbouring village of Askham Bryan is home to the highly regarded Askham Bryan Agricultural College, and the villages of Bilbrough, Rufforth and Copmanthorpe are also close by.
