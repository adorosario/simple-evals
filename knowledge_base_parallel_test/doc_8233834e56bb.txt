All shields deal Strike physical damage, except for the Pierce Shield's Thrust damage. Augmented (Fire, Lightning, Magic, Divine) shields also deal damage with their respective element. Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. Damage Reduction %: The Damage Reduction % of the shield. It dictates how much damage the shield mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for shields are W / X / Y / Z: W is Physical Damage X is Magical Damage Y is Fire Damage Z is Lightning Damage Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows players to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the shield. The effectiveness of the shield will severely deteriorate when the durability falls below 30%. Weight: The weight of the shield. Note that carrying over 50% of a character's Equip Weight will reduce the speed of their rolls, while going over 100% will reduce their regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave them momentarily stunned. Requirements: Determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the shield effectively. The requirement stats for shields are W / X / Y / Z: W is the Strength required X is the Dexterity required Y is the Intelligence required Z is the Faith required While it is possible to use a shield with lower-than-required Strength, the character will suffer a severe penalty to stability, thus making it easier to break their guard. demon_weaponshield page revision: 73, last edited: 01 Apr 2022 09:25 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.
