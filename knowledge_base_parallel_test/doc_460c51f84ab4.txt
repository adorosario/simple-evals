Dialogue All dialogue text is © Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. + Show Dialogue - Hide Dialogue Greeting Good day to you. Care to look over the wares? Mostly stolen, but who's telling, eh? Hello. What can I do for you? Ah, we meet again. Fancy that. Hope you find something that suits you. First encounter (1-1) Be you brave knight or depraved slave, the Demons will snatch your soul, then you'll go mad. And those who dare cling to their humanity are hunted down. It is the end of Great Boletaria as we know it. But hell, at least the Demons don't send us to our deaths in battle! Heh heh heh heh. There's this skinny fellow, clad in fabulous armour, who is always mumbling about some mission. He's another one who's managed to stay sane like yourself. Probably some pampered son, by the looks of his attire. I'd give an arm just for the buttons off his shirt! Second encounter (1-2) The giant lizard? One of the kings pets, just like those Demons. That monster leaves a trail of charred carcasses. Which is great for business, of course! But unless you're a scavenger like me, you'd better stay clear. Heh heh heh. Third encounter (1-3) The King? He's gone mad like the rest of them. Or perhaps he was mad in the first place. I can never tell with those eccentric royal oafs! Leaving after purchase Thanks for that. Come back soon. Leaving without buying Go ahead, take your time. I'm not going anywhere. Heh heh heh. Hard times, eh? I'm sure you'll turn things around. Heh heh heh. Walk away without "Leave" Hold it friend! Going so soon? Next return Go on. Treat yourself to something. When attacked I'm not afraid! I'll tear you limb from limb! 1-11-21-3boletarianmerchantnpcpalacevendor page revision: 60, last edited: 08 Jan 2021 01:39 Edit Rate (0) Tags Discuss (1) History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.
