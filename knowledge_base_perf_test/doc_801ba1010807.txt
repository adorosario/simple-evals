In 2007, he completed his PhD in Pavia (Supervisor: Professor Maurizio Fagnoni) focusing on photochemical arylations via phenyl cations. Later he moved to LASIR Laboratory (Lille, France), where he investigated the photoreactivity and the photophysics of flavonoids. He came back to Pavia and started working in the field of (photo)green synthetic chemistry. After a postdoctoral stay at the iBitTec-S laboratory (CEA Saclay, France) carrying out studies on photocatalyzed oxidation reactions for energy storage, he moved again to Pavia. In the 2011-2013 period he has been responsible of the Pavia Unit in the project "FIRB 2008 - New generation methodologies in the formation of new carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds under eco-friendly conditions", in collaboration with the universities of Camerino and Perugia. Since 2018 he is Associate Professor at the University of Pavia, Italy. He is currently editor of the Specialist Periodical Reports in Photochemistry of the Royal Society of Chemistry, member of the Early Career Board of the ACS Sustainable Chemistry and Engineering and of the International Advisory Board of the European Journal of Organic Chemistry. Stefano Protti is co-author of about 120 research articles and reviews (H-index 31, 3335 citations, Scopus), besides 18 contributed chapters in multi-authored books and the book "Paradigms in Green Chemistry and Technology", Springer UK. He has been the recipient of the Ciamician Medal (best young organic chemist of the year, 2013) by the Italian Chemical Society (SCI) for original research in the field of organic chemistry and of the Alfredo Di Braccio Prize (2014) by the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. The results of his research have been presented at National and International meetings. The research activity of Stefano Protti has been mainly focused on the development of new synthetic methods for the light driven formation of C-C and C-heteroatom bonds under metal free conditions.
