Among minor planet observers, this observatory is mostly known for the work of Johann Palisa. This paper provides a short biography of Johann Palisa, as well as some information about his discoveries. Palisa was director of the Pola observatory from 1872 until 1880. He discovered 28 minor planets and one comet during that time. In 1880, he took a position at the new Vienna observatory. Here, he discovered further 94 minor planets, all by visual observations. His most famous discovery is probably the Amor-type asteroid (719) Albert. Today, Palisa remains the most successful visual discoverer of asteroids. A short biography of Johann Palisa used to send his assistants to bed at midnight, but continued to observe until the break of dawn, handling the Johann Palisa was born on December 6, 1848 in Troppau, instrument all alone. Palisa discovered further 94 asteroids Silesia (now Czech Republic) [1,2]. From 1866 to 1870 he at Vienna, all by visual observations, using the 27” and the studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of 12” refractor. In addition, Palisa discovered eight objects Vienna, but did not graduate until 1884. Already in 1870, that were included by Dreyer in the NGC catalogue, as he became assistant at the University observatory in well as four nebulae listed in the IC.

Pola (now Pula) was harbor of the Austrian Navy from 1850 until the empire of Austria-Hungary collapsed at the end of World War I. Figure 1: The Pola Observatory in the 19th century. Palisa discovered his first asteroid, (136) Austria [3], at Figure 2: Portrait of Johann Palisa. Pola on 1874 March 18, using a 6” refractor.

During the eclipse, he searched for the proposed planet When the new Vienna observatory was inaugurated in Vulcan, which was supposed to circle the sun within the 1880 by emperor Franz Joseph I, he was offered a position orbit of Mercury. In addition to observing the eclipse, as “Adjunkt”, comparable to a modern night assistant. Palisa collected insects for the Natural History Museum in Palisa gave up his position as director of the Naval Vienna.
