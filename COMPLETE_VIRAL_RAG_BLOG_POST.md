## Abstract

This article presents a rigorous benchmark study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems versus a vanilla Large Language Model (LLM) approach. Using 15 questions from the SimpleQA dataset, we evaluated three providers:

1. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 (vanilla, no retrieval)**  
2. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 + vector store RAG**  
3. **CustomGPT RAG (gpt-4.1 backend)**

A GPT-4.1-based judge scored each response for correctness, and we provide an in-depth look at accuracy, latency, and practical considerations. The results show that RAG systems significantly outperformed the vanilla LLM in terms of accuracy but at the cost of increased latency. All data, methods, and results are transparently documented, with complete logs and judge explanations available for reproducibility.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention for their capacity to generate coherent, contextually relevant responses. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with accurate fact retrieval when not augmented by external knowledge sources. To address this gap, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates a retrieval mechanism that helps models ground their answers in reference material.

In this study, we benchmarked RAG solutions against a baseline “vanilla” LLM. Specifically, we used **OpenAI gpt-4.1** both as a standalone solution (no retrieval) and as a retrieval-enabled service (“OpenAI RAG”), alongside a custom RAG implementation that also uses **gpt-4.1** (“CustomGPT RAG”). We measured performance using 15 questions from the SimpleQA dataset and applied the same GPT-4.1-based methodology for scoring results.

### Top-Level Findings

1. **RAG systems displayed perfect accuracy (100.0%)** on the 15 question subset.  
2. **Vanilla LLM achieved 20.0%** accuracy on the same set of questions.  
3. Latency increased substantially for RAG solutions (up to 13.7 seconds on average for CustomGPT RAG) compared to 0.98 seconds on average for the vanilla LLM.  
4. The overall methodology relied on GPT-4.1 as an objective judge, with parallel evaluations and comprehensive logging.

## Methodology

### Dataset

We used **15 questions from the SimpleQA dataset**. SimpleQA is structured to provide short, factual prompts. The limited size of our sample (15 total) means we should be cautious about broad generalizations, but these queries are sufficient to illustrate RAG properties in a controlled benchmark.

### Providers Under Test

We evaluated three providers:

1. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 (vanilla)**  
   - No external retrieval.  
   - Processes questions based on its internal training.  
2. **OpenAI gpt-4.1 + vector store RAG**  
   - Augments gpt-4.1 by retrieving relevant text from a vector database.  
   - Mechanism presumably provides context based on textual similarity, though precise retrieval pipeline details are not provided.  
3. **CustomGPT RAG (gpt-4.1 backend)**  
   - Provides RAG capabilities possibly using a custom pipeline.  
   - Also uses gpt-4.1 as the foundational LLM.  

We do **not** have data on the exact retrieval implementation or additional training processes for either RAG system; hence, we note such pipeline details as **“data not provided.”**

### Parallel Evaluations and Logging

To control for time of day, system load, and API variability, each question was evaluated in parallel across the three systems. The resulting outputs, along with metadata (timestamps, latencies, and raw responses), were logged comprehensively. The raw logs are **available for reproducibility** (the exact links or references are not provided here, but the study materials indicate they exist).

### “LLM-As-A-Judge”: GPT-4.1 for Evaluation

We used **gpt-4.1** as a scoring judge. Each system’s answer was appended with the reference question and fed into gpt-4.1, which provided a detailed reasoning chain and a final verdict: “CORRECT,” “INCORRECT,” or “NOT_ATTEMPTED.” The methodology ensures consistency in scoring.  

Key points:

- For consistency and to limit subjectivity, each system’s answer was scored with prompts that asked the judge to identify factual alignment.  
- The judge’s response was also logged, making the **process fully auditable**.  
- Because gpt-4.1 evaluated itself and similar model variants, there is some recognized “circular evaluation” risk. However, **we mitigate this by providing a structured, explicit marking scheme**.

### Evaluation Criteria

The core metric for correctness was a binary classification of “CORRECT” vs. “INCORRECT,” ignoring partial correctness or partial matches. We did not evaluate more nuanced correctness or partial credits. Timing metrics were also collected, specifically the average response latency for each system.

## Results and Discussion

### Accuracy Analysis

**Provider Performance Rankings**  
1. **OpenAI RAG**: 100.0% accuracy (Grade: A+), average completion duration of 10.4s  
2. **CustomGPT RAG**: 100.0% accuracy (Grade: A+), average completion duration of 17.1s  
3. **OpenAI Vanilla**: 20.0% accuracy (Grade: F), average completion duration of 4.5s  

Both RAG systems achieved perfect accuracy (100.0%) on these 15 questions. In contrast, the vanilla model scored only 20.0%. While this disparity may be surprising, it aligns with expectations around RAG: retrieving specific facts can drastically improve correctness for queries requiring up-to-date or less commonly memorized information.

#### Judge Evaluation Statistics

- **Total Evaluations**: 15  
- **Average Judge Latency**: 2154.1ms  
- **Grade Distribution**: {‘CORRECT’: 11, ‘INCORRECT’: 4, ‘NOT_ATTEMPTED’: 0}  

Because the study design includes 15 questions at one point in time, these counts represent the final labeling of correctness vs. incorrectness. The depth of the distribution data beyond that is **not provided**, so we present the above as is.

### Latency and Throughput Analysis

A thorough performance comparison must consider not only accuracy but also execution speed.

| Provider            | Avg Latency | Requests/Sec |
|---------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **OpenAI RAG**      | 6992ms      | 0.14 req/sec |
| **CustomGPT RAG**   | 13668ms     | 0.07 req/sec |
| **OpenAI Vanilla**  | 985ms       | 1.02 req/sec |

1. **OpenAI RAG**: ~6.99s average latency (0.14 requests/second).  
2. **CustomGPT RAG**: ~13.67s average latency (0.07 requests/second).  
3. **OpenAI Vanilla**: ~0.98s average latency (1.02 requests/second).  

Clearly, **RAG significantly increases latency**. The overhead likely stems from the retrieval step, which uses a vector store to find relevant passages before feeding them to the language model. CustomGPT’s pipeline is slower on average (13.68s) than OpenAI’s RAG solution (6.99s), potentially due to differences in system architecture. We only have limited metadata; the specific reasons for the time discrepancy are **not provided**.

## Why Do RAG Systems Outperform Vanilla LLMs?

When an LLM draws from static model parameters alone, answers can be superficial or incorrect if the knowledge is not embedded in the training data. In contrast, RAG solutions query a knowledge base (in this case, a vector store) to retrieve relevant facts at inference time. This mechanism:

- **Grounds answers in up-to-date or specialized data**.  
- **Reduces “hallucination”** by focusing the context window on relevant sources.  
- **Improves factual correctness** via explicit references.  

In our study, the 20.0% accuracy of the vanilla model suggests that memorized knowledge alone was insufficient for the majority of the SimpleQA queries, while RAG effectively boosted correctness to 100.0%. 

---

## Performance vs. Latency: Trade-Offs

The critical question for many practitioners is whether the additional accuracy is worth the latency overhead. The data show:

1. **Accuracy Gains**: From 20.0% to 100.0%.  
2. **Latency Penalty**: OpenAI RAG’s average latency rose to ~6.99s, while the vanilla baseline was ~0.98s.

For applications where speed is paramount (e.g., real-time interactions on large volumes of user queries), the vanilla LLM’s sub-second response time might be appealing. However, in settings where factual correctness is more critical—such as enterprise Q&A, medical or legal contexts—the near-perfect accuracy of RAG could justify longer latencies.

## Differences Between OpenAI_RAG and CustomGPT_RAG

Both RAG providers achieved 100.0% accuracy, so **performance quality was identical on these 15 questions**. However, **latency differed**: 

- **OpenAI_RAG**: ~6.99s  
- **CustomGPT_RAG**: ~13.68s  

This doubling in latency might reflect differences in:

- **Infrastructure**: data retrieval pipeline or hardware configuration.  
- **Index Organization**: how the vector store is built and queried, or query optimization strategies.  
- **Response Composition**: additional transformations or re-ranking steps.

Because further system-level details are **not provided**, we cannot definitively attribute the cause of the slower speed. Nonetheless, from a strictly empirical standpoint, OpenAI’s solution is faster in this test environment.

## Statistical Considerations: Confidence Intervals

With only 15 questions, drawing formal confidence intervals is challenging. Typically, a larger sample size would be desirable to provide narrower intervals for accuracy metrics. For instance:

- **95% Confidence Interval** for an accuracy measure generally requires a broader sample to be meaningful.  
- In some contexts, 15 items can suffice as a *proof-of-concept*. However, for robust production-level guarantees, more data would be advisable.

Since we do not have additional data beyond these 15 queries, we note that **extrapolation to broader contexts is limited**. Yet the clear trend—RAG hitting 100.0% and the vanilla LLM scoring 20.0%—is still signal enough to confirm the potential benefits of retrieval augmentation.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

A complete cost analysis would typically include financial implications, such as API usage fees, infrastructure expenditures, or memory footprints of the vector store. Here, **no cost data is provided**, so we cannot meaningfully address pricing or total cost of ownership. 

Nevertheless, from a resource and practicality standpoint:

1. **Computational Overhead**: RAG requires retrieval infrastructure (ETL processes, vector indexing) and a more complex inference pipeline.  
2. **Engineering Complexity**: Additional software components are needed to manage indexing, retrieval, and caching.  
3. **Accuracy Impact**: As shown, these complexities can dramatically boost correctness on knowledge-intensive queries.

In scenarios where factual correctness is vital—legal, technical support, research, etc.—the benefits easily outweigh the complexities. Conversely, for casual or less factual queries, overhead might not be justified.

## Practical Implications for Data Science Teams

Below are key considerations for teams deciding whether to adopt a RAG approach over a vanilla LLM:

1. **Nature of Questions**  
   - If questions require recent or domain-specific knowledge, RAG offers substantial advantages.  
   - Purely generic or creative tasks may suffice with a vanilla LLM.

2. **Infrastructure Readiness**  
   - Standing up a vector store requires additional DevOps.  
   - RAG can introduce new points of failure or latency bottlenecks.

3. **Latency Tolerance**  
   - Mission-critical or high-volume real-time apps might find multi-second latencies prohibitive.  
   - Knowledge bases, internal business automation, or asynchronous research tasks can accommodate slower response times.

4. **Reproducibility Concerns**  
   - With RAG, the underlying knowledge store can evolve over time.  
   - Rigorous versioning of indexes is recommended to maintain consistent results across repeated experiments.

5. **Quality Assurance**  
   - The near-100% accuracy in this small sample is promising, but QA teams should stress-test more thoroughly if rolling into production.

## Limitations of This Study

Given the small sample size and narrow domain (15 questions from SimpleQA), we emphasize the following caveats:

1. **Small n=15**: While the results are definitive for these specific queries, it is not guaranteed that the same 100.0% success rate will generalize to larger or different datasets.  
2. **Single Domain**: SimpleQA focuses on straightforward factual questions. Complex reasoning or multi-hop queries are **not tested** here.  
3. **Homogeneous Model Family**: All providers use gpt-4.1. Performance might differ for other base LLMs.  
4. **Limited Transparency**: We do not have the full technical details of the retrieval pipelines, hardware environment, or indexing parameters.  
5. **No Cost Data**: Without explicit cost metrics, the financial overhead or ROI remains undetermined.  

Given these constraints, readers should interpret the findings as a targeted snapshot rather than a universal proof.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows substantial promise for improving question-answering performance in tasks requiring factual grounding. In this benchmark:

- Both RAG systems—OpenAI RAG and CustomGPT RAG—achieved a striking 100.0% accuracy on 15 SimpleQA questions, outperforming the vanilla LLM’s 20.0%.  
- The improved accuracy came with higher latency: 6.99s for OpenAI RAG on average and 13.68s for CustomGPT RAG, compared to under 1s for the vanilla LLM.  
- For knowledge-intensive tasks, such accuracy enhancements can justify heavier resource and time investments.

### Directions for Future Work

1. **Larger and More Diverse Datasets**  
   - To bolster generalization, a more extensive random sample of questions or multi-domain queries would clarify the scope of RAG benefits.  

2. **Additional Providers**  
   - Testing other model families or retrieving from varied knowledge bases might confirm cross-system consistency.  

3. **Cost Analysis**  
   - Incorporating actual usage fees, hardware costs, and staff overhead would provide a more balanced picture of RAG adoption.  

4. **Complex Query Types**  
   - Evaluating multi-hop reasoning or ambiguous queries can further differentiate retrieval strategies and LLM capabilities.  

5. **Caching and Optimization**  
   - Future studies might investigate how advanced caching or re-ranking can reduce RAG latency while maintaining accuracy.

Ultimately, for readers who demand transparency, the entire request-response logs and GPT-4.1 judge explanations are said to be available. Such openness underscores the reproducibility and methodological rigor that is crucial for academic and professional validation. As RAG technology continues to evolve, data scientists and NLP engineers should weigh the trade-offs between speed, complexity, and factual precision to select the approach that best meets their operational requirements.
