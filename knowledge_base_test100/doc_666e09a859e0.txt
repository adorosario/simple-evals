The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 41, last edited: 24 Jun 2016 20:18 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 41, last edited: 24 Jun 2016 20:18 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Editing Recent Changes Changes Needed Sandbox (Test Page) Sitemap Puzzling Stone Sword Dark Souls II Wiki » Weapons » Straightswords » Puzzling Stone Sword In-Game Description A sword with a segmented blade. When swung, its segments separate and the sword strikes in a whipping slash. Crafted with a rare magnetic stone of remarkable strength only found deep within caves of the Gutter. Availability Dragon's Sanctum treasure. Found in a metal chest in a room unlocked by two buttons in the corridor (can only be activated with projectiles). Preceding room has wall spikes. Video Location Razorback Nightcrawler (Cave of the Dead) drop - very rare. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, Cerah the Old Explorer drop - very rare (Note: Drops much more often when you are summoned to another player's world as a phantom).

Notes Despite its whip-like moveset, it is parryable. Possibly a reference to the Soul Calibur series of fighting games, as it behaves identically to the "Snake Sword" used by Ivy, one of the main characters of the series. (Parts of its moveset almost identical to Ivy's moveset as well.) Strong Attack deals more damage if you are close to the opponent. Can be used in multiple powerstances and copies the moveset of the copied weapons stance. (Tested with clubs, axes, greatswords, rapiers, daggers and lances.) Despite its low base damage, the DEX scaling bonus is outstanding. At 50 DEX, the AR is (145+149), with Ring of Blades+2 and Flynn's Ring, the AR goes up to (145+249) Upgrades FoldUnfold Upgrades Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Basic Special upgrade path.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 41, last edited: 24 Jun 2016 20:18 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Editing Recent Changes Changes Needed Sandbox (Test Page) Sitemap Puzzling Stone Sword Dark Souls II Wiki » Weapons » Straightswords » Puzzling Stone Sword In-Game Description A sword with a segmented blade. When swung, its segments separate and the sword strikes in a whipping slash. Crafted with a rare magnetic stone of remarkable strength only found deep within caves of the Gutter. Availability Dragon's Sanctum treasure. Found in a metal chest in a room unlocked by two buttons in the corridor (can only be activated with projectiles). Preceding room has wall spikes. Video Location Razorback Nightcrawler (Cave of the Dead) drop - very rare. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, Cerah the Old Explorer drop - very rare (Note: Drops much more often when you are summoned to another player's world as a phantom).

Notes Despite its whip-like moveset, it is parryable. Possibly a reference to the Soul Calibur series of fighting games, as it behaves identically to the "Snake Sword" used by Ivy, one of the main characters of the series. (Parts of its moveset almost identical to Ivy's moveset as well.) Strong Attack deals more damage if you are close to the opponent. Can be used in multiple powerstances and copies the moveset of the copied weapons stance. (Tested with clubs, axes, greatswords, rapiers, daggers and lances.) Despite its low base damage, the DEX scaling bonus is outstanding. At 50 DEX, the AR is (145+149), with Ring of Blades+2 and Flynn's Ring, the AR goes up to (145+249) Upgrades FoldUnfold Upgrades Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Basic Special upgrade path.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 41, last edited: 24 Jun 2016 20:18 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

Editing Recent Changes Changes Needed Sandbox (Test Page) Sitemap Puzzling Stone Sword Dark Souls II Wiki » Weapons » Straightswords » Puzzling Stone Sword In-Game Description A sword with a segmented blade. When swung, its segments separate and the sword strikes in a whipping slash. Crafted with a rare magnetic stone of remarkable strength only found deep within caves of the Gutter. Availability Dragon's Sanctum treasure. Found in a metal chest in a room unlocked by two buttons in the corridor (can only be activated with projectiles). Preceding room has wall spikes. Video Location Razorback Nightcrawler (Cave of the Dead) drop - very rare. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, Cerah the Old Explorer drop - very rare (Note: Drops much more often when you are summoned to another player's world as a phantom).

Notes Despite its whip-like moveset, it is parryable. Possibly a reference to the Soul Calibur series of fighting games, as it behaves identically to the "Snake Sword" used by Ivy, one of the main characters of the series. (Parts of its moveset almost identical to Ivy's moveset as well.) Strong Attack deals more damage if you are close to the opponent. Can be used in multiple powerstances and copies the moveset of the copied weapons stance. (Tested with clubs, axes, greatswords, rapiers, daggers and lances.) Despite its low base damage, the DEX scaling bonus is outstanding. At 50 DEX, the AR is (145+149), with Ring of Blades+2 and Flynn's Ring, the AR goes up to (145+249) Upgrades FoldUnfold Upgrades Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Basic Special upgrade path.

When swung, its segments separate and the sword strikes in a whipping slash. Crafted with a rare magnetic stone of remarkable strength only found deep within caves of the Gutter. Availability Dragon's Sanctum treasure. Found in a metal chest in a room unlocked by two buttons in the corridor (can only be activated with projectiles). Preceding room has wall spikes. Video Location Razorback Nightcrawler (Cave of the Dead) drop - very rare. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, Cerah the Old Explorer drop - very rare (Note: Drops much more often when you are summoned to another player's world as a phantom).

Notes Despite its whip-like moveset, it is parryable. Possibly a reference to the Soul Calibur series of fighting games, as it behaves identically to the "Snake Sword" used by Ivy, one of the main characters of the series. (Parts of its moveset almost identical to Ivy's moveset as well.) Strong Attack deals more damage if you are close to the opponent. Can be used in multiple powerstances and copies the moveset of the copied weapons stance. (Tested with clubs, axes, greatswords, rapiers, daggers and lances.) Despite its low base damage, the DEX scaling bonus is outstanding. At 50 DEX, the AR is (145+149), with Ring of Blades+2 and Flynn's Ring, the AR goes up to (145+249) Upgrades FoldUnfold Upgrades Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Basic Special upgrade path.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. In-Game Description A sword with a segmented blade.

Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. In-Game Description A sword with a segmented blade. When swung, its segments separate and the sword strikes in a whipping slash. Crafted with a rare magnetic stone of remarkable strength only found deep within caves of the Gutter. Availability Dragon's Sanctum treasure. Found in a metal chest in a room unlocked by two buttons in the corridor (can only be activated with projectiles). Preceding room has wall spikes. Video Location Razorback Nightcrawler (Cave of the Dead) drop - very rare. Afflicted Graverobber, Ancient Soldier Varg, Cerah the Old Explorer drop - very rare (Note: Drops much more often when you are summoned to another player's world as a phantom).

Despite its whip-like moveset, it is parryable. Possibly a reference to the Soul Calibur series of fighting games, as it behaves identically to the "Snake Sword" used by Ivy, one of the main characters of the series. (Parts of its moveset almost identical to Ivy's moveset as well.) Strong Attack deals more damage if you are close to the opponent. Can be used in multiple powerstances and copies the moveset of the copied weapons stance. (Tested with clubs, axes, greatswords, rapiers, daggers and lances.) Despite its low base damage, the DEX scaling bonus is outstanding. At 50 DEX, the AR is (145+149), with Ring of Blades+2 and Flynn's Ring, the AR goes up to (145+249) FoldUnfold Upgrades Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Notes Basic Magic Fire Lightning Dark Poison Bleed Raw Enchanted Mundane Special upgrade path.
