Telangana high court HYDERABAD: Stating that the special investigation team (SIT) probe into the December 2019 'encounter' killings of four suspects in the Disha rape and murder case has raised several doubts on impartiality of the probe, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy on Monday said that a murder case should be booked against all the 10 cops who took part in the encounter. Prakash Reddy, who is the amicus curiae in the case, said the probe should be entrusted to an independent agency while putting forth his argument before a bench of Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice N Tukaramji. The bench took up the case following the Supreme Court asking it to decide the next course of action after hearing the relevant parties. 'Accused encounter cops in Disha case may come out unscathed, fair trial must' Prakash Reddy contended that there should be a fair trial against the 10 cops. "They may get a clean chit and may come out unscathed. But it should happen through a process of law and courts. Police personnel who take part in encounters cannot escape from this process because the Supreme Court in PUCL and other cases clearly said that an FIR against the cops is a must. The current practice of police booking cases against the deceased cannot be allowed," he said. Telangana State Police Officers' Association and Disha's father wanted to be impleaded in the case. The bench, while discouraging the father of Disha from reliving the trauma again, however, indicated to the police officers' association that it may hear them without impleading them in the next hearing.Indian Association of People's Lawyers too filed an implead plea and said that it was supporting the argument of amicus curiae and urged the court to order slapping of IPC 302 charges against the accused cops. The state counsel sought time to present the version of the government. The bench posted the case to March 29.Disha, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in the state-run hospital at Kollur, was found dead on the morning of November 28, 2019, under Chatanpally bridge in Shadnagar. She was raped and murdered, sparking widespread outrage. Police arrested four persons who were suspected to have raped and killed Disha. On the morning of December 6, 2019, they were shot dead by armed policemen when they were taken out for reconstructing the crime scene and for recovering the articles of Disha. Police claimed that they were forced to kill the suspects in self-defence after they started attacking cops at the crime spot.Later, the SC constituted the three-member Justice VS Sirpurkar Commission of Inquiry, which trashed the theory of the encounter of the four suspects and recommended that an FIR be lodged against the 10 cops involved. The apex court, however, left the issue to the Telangana HC and asked the latter to take a call after perusing commission of inquiry report and after hearing all the relevant parties.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previousâ10 heaviest animals on EarthLifestyle8 plants that look best in hanging pots and basketsLifestyle9 animals that start hibernating in OctoberLifestyleââHow to make Vrat-friendly South Indian-style curd rice for NavratriâFoodExpert tips to boost brainpower in kids during their growing yearsLifestyleHow to make Sweet Potato Cutlets for vrat feastingFood8 tiger sanctuaries in India that are best explored by jeeptravelA 7-day Himachal itinerary for Navratri long weekendtravelDurga Puja 2024: Mouni Roy's pujo-perfect drapes that redefine graceEntertainmentThis iron-calcium rich Ragi Gajar Paratha is perfect for a strong immunityFood Next123 Photostories 5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showâBigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8â10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyâ10 most educated countries of the worldâHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru QuotesTrending StoriesIn CityEntire Website"Travis Kelce's career is over": Travis Kelceâs time in Kansas City may be numbered as the Chiefs decided to re-sign one of their familiar facesTravis Kelce's Ex Kayla Nicole Delivers a Powerful 'Mental Health' Message While Facing Backlash from Taylor Swift Fans'Diddy List': Names of celebrities connected to Sean Combs viral3 dead in Chennai after Indian Air Force air showFour spectators dead after Chennai air showPresident Muizzu in India: 'Will never hurt India's security interests, Maldives first but will prioritise ties with India'1 dead, 10 injured in massive explosion near Karachi airportIAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes'Wouldn't have given birth': Gaza mother struggles to provide for newborns amid conflictRishabh Pant's Masterclass: How India conquered the fortress Gabba'Hope to welcome more Indian tourists': Maldives President Muizzu after meeting PM ModiRahul's heartfelt cooking session with Dalit man, his family;

Telangana high court HYDERABAD: Stating that the special investigation team (SIT) probe into the December 2019 'encounter' killings of four suspects in the Disha rape and murder case has raised several doubts on impartiality of the probe, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy on Monday said that a murder case should be booked against all the 10 cops who took part in the encounter. Prakash Reddy, who is the amicus curiae in the case, said the probe should be entrusted to an independent agency while putting forth his argument before a bench of Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice N Tukaramji. The bench took up the case following the Supreme Court asking it to decide the next course of action after hearing the relevant parties. 'Accused encounter cops in Disha case may come out unscathed, fair trial must' Prakash Reddy contended that there should be a fair trial against the 10 cops. "They may get a clean chit and may come out unscathed. But it should happen through a process of law and courts. Police personnel who take part in encounters cannot escape from this process because the Supreme Court in PUCL and other cases clearly said that an FIR against the cops is a must. The current practice of police booking cases against the deceased cannot be allowed," he said. Telangana State Police Officers' Association and Disha's father wanted to be impleaded in the case. The bench, while discouraging the father of Disha from reliving the trauma again, however, indicated to the police officers' association that it may hear them without impleading them in the next hearing.Indian Association of People's Lawyers too filed an implead plea and said that it was supporting the argument of amicus curiae and urged the court to order slapping of IPC 302 charges against the accused cops. The state counsel sought time to present the version of the government. The bench posted the case to March 29.Disha, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in the state-run hospital at Kollur, was found dead on the morning of November 28, 2019, under Chatanpally bridge in Shadnagar.

'Accused encounter cops in Disha case may come out unscathed, fair trial must' Prakash Reddy contended that there should be a fair trial against the 10 cops. "They may get a clean chit and may come out unscathed. But it should happen through a process of law and courts. Police personnel who take part in encounters cannot escape from this process because the Supreme Court in PUCL and other cases clearly said that an FIR against the cops is a must. The current practice of police booking cases against the deceased cannot be allowed," he said. Telangana State Police Officers' Association and Disha's father wanted to be impleaded in the case. The bench, while discouraging the father of Disha from reliving the trauma again, however, indicated to the police officers' association that it may hear them without impleading them in the next hearing.Indian Association of People's Lawyers too filed an implead plea and said that it was supporting the argument of amicus curiae and urged the court to order slapping of IPC 302 charges against the accused cops. The state counsel sought time to present the version of the government. The bench posted the case to March 29.Disha, a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in the state-run hospital at Kollur, was found dead on the morning of November 28, 2019, under Chatanpally bridge in Shadnagar. She was raped and murdered, sparking widespread outrage. Police arrested four persons who were suspected to have raped and killed Disha. On the morning of December 6, 2019, they were shot dead by armed policemen when they were taken out for reconstructing the crime scene and for recovering the articles of Disha. Police claimed that they were forced to kill the suspects in self-defence after they started attacking cops at the crime spot.Later, the SC constituted the three-member Justice VS Sirpurkar Commission of Inquiry, which trashed the theory of the encounter of the four suspects and recommended that an FIR be lodged against the 10 cops involved. The apex court, however, left the issue to the Telangana HC and asked the latter to take a call after perusing commission of inquiry report and after hearing all the relevant parties.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previousâ10 heaviest animals on EarthLifestyle8 plants that look best in hanging pots and basketsLifestyle9 animals that start hibernating in OctoberLifestyleââHow to make Vrat-friendly South Indian-style curd rice for NavratriâFoodExpert tips to boost brainpower in kids during their growing yearsLifestyleHow to make Sweet Potato Cutlets for vrat feastingFood8 tiger sanctuaries in India that are best explored by jeeptravelA 7-day Himachal itinerary for Navratri long weekendtravelDurga Puja 2024: Mouni Roy's pujo-perfect drapes that redefine graceEntertainmentThis iron-calcium rich Ragi Gajar Paratha is perfect for a strong immunityFood Next123 Photostories 5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldBigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showâBigg Boss Tamil 8: Confirmed list of contestants of Vijay Sethupathi hosted show Bigg Boss Tamil 8â10 most powerful countries in the world in 20247 vegetables that reduce belly fat quicklyâ10 most educated countries of the worldâHow tall are Trump family membersTGIKS 2: From impersonating legendary cricketer MS Dhoni to revealing secrets from the World Cup: Top moments featuring Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and othersWhere the zodiac signs would prefer to liveFrom Bharti Singh- Elvish Yadav getting summoned in Rs 500 crore fraud case to Khushi Mali replacing Palak Sindhwani in Taarak Mehta: Top TV newsSunny Deol's 'Gadar', Shah Rukh Khan's 'Devdas', Rishi Kapoor's 'Chandni': Movies allegedly rejected by GovindaOptical illusion psychology test: The first thing you see reveals the hidden flaw affecting your relationships123Hot PicksIsrael Hezbollah War LiveBhopal Factory Drug SeizeGang Attack in HaitiAIIMS Doctors Candle MarchPakistan Airport ExplosionChennai Air Show ChaosHurricane Milton EvacuationTOP TRENDINGKarachi Airport BlastKayla NicoleWorld Richest FamilyThe San Francisco 49ersIsrael MossadPrince WilliamPresident MuizzuChinese Spy BallonsRishabh PantSadhguru Quotes Stating that the special investigation team (SIT) probe into the December 2019 'encounter' killings of four suspects in the Disha rape and murder case has raised several doubts on impartiality of the probe, senior counsel D Prakash Reddy on Monday said that a murder case should be booked against all the 10 cops who took part in the encounter.
