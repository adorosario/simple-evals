Ndoye will be assisted in the Rades stadium by Ali Tomusange of Uganda and Zimbabwe's Brighton Mudzamiri. Ndoye's selection signals a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for the Senegalese referee. In February 2001, Caf banned Ndoye from refereeing for one year after his poor performance in a Nations Cup qualifying match. Following Angola's 1-0 defeat by Burkina Faso in the Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou, the Angolans protested over Ndoye's refereeing after the Senegalese official disallowed a legitimate-looking Palancas Negras goal. Caf reviewed the video tape of the match after the Angolan protest and, based on his performance, Ndoye was suspended for 12 months. The ban was later shortened to nine months. Ndoye, 43, has been a member of the Fifa panel since 1993 and has officiated at four successive Nations Cup tournaments. He also handled one match, the Group E game between Saudi Arabia and Ireland, at the 2002 World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan.
