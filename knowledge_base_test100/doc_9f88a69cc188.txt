The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 24, last edited: 20 Apr 2016 16:56 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 24, last edited: 20 Apr 2016 16:56 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 24, last edited: 20 Apr 2016 16:56 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Help | Terms of Service | Privacy | Report a bug | Flag as objectionable | Update cookie settings Powered by Wikidot.com Unless otherwise stated, the content of this page is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License Subscription expired — please renew Pro account upgrade has expired for this site and the site is now locked.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. dlcweapon page revision: 24, last edited: 20 Apr 2016 16:56 Edit Rate (0) Tags History Files Print Site tools + Options Edit Sections Append Edit Meta Watchers Backlinks Page Source Parent Lock Page Rename Delete Dark Souls II Wiki » Weapons » Straightswords » Fume Sword In-Game Description Straight sword forged from the soul of the fume knight, and imbued with the Dark of Nadalia.

The Damage stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D / E: A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Each weapon has one or more physical damage types: Striking Slashing Thrusting Certain enemies are weak or strong against different damage types. See Weakness for physical reduction, Resistance for elemental reduction. Aux Effect: The Aux Effect stat dictates how effective the weapon will be at causing the effect. The Aux Effect stats for a weapon are A / B: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect Counter Strength: Damage multiplier when hitting an enemy that is performing an action such as attacking. Value of 100 means no extra damage. Poise Damage: The ability of the weapon to break the poise of an enemy. Stats Needed: The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The stats required for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is the Strength required B is the Dexterity required C is the Intelligence required D is the Faith required Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical damage of the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon. Also keep in mind that your character gains a 100% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus reducing the actual Strength required. For example, a character with 14 Strength can wield a Great Club (Requires 28 Strength) properly if the weapon is held with both hands. (14 x 2 = 28) Stat Bonuses: The Stat Bonuses rating indicates the level of bonus damage you do with the weapon, based on the associated Stat. This rating can be S, A, B, C, D, or E (in order from most to least bonus for the associated skill). See Scaling for more information. The Bonus Stats for a weapon are A/B/C/D/E/F: A is the Strength stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. B is the Dexterity stat bonus that influences the physical attack of the weapon. C is the Intelligence stat bonus that influences the Magical attack of the weapon. D is the Intelligence and Faith stat bonus that influences the Fire attack of the weapon. E is the Faith stat bonus that influences the Lightning attack of the weapon. F is the Intelligence or Faith stat bonus that influence the Dark attack of the weapon(The lower of the two stats is chosen as the bonus stat). Damage Reduction: The Damage Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much damage the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Damage Reduction % stats for weapons are A / B / C / D / E : A is Physical Damage B is Magical Damage C is Fire Damage D is Lightning Damage E is Dark Damage Aux Effect Reduction: The Aux Effect Reduction % of the weapon. It dictates how much of the effect the weapon mitigates while blocking. The Aux Effect Reduction % stats for a weapon are A / B / C / D: A is Poison Effect B is Bleed Effect C is Petrification Effect D is Curse Effect Stability: Determines the amount of stamina expended to block an incoming attack. A higher stability also allows you to block stronger attacks without breaking guard and reduces the amount of stamina depleted from blocking attacks. Durability: The durability of the weapon. Weight: The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 70% of your Equip Weight will reduce the speed of your rolls, while going over 100% will reduce your regular speed to walking and attempts to roll or backstep will leave you momentarily stunned. Enchantable? Items/Spells: Determines whether or not the weapon can receive a temporary damage buff by items and/or spells. Note that if you decided to infuse the weapon it cannot be enchanted by items. In-Game Description Straight sword forged from the soul of the fume knight, and imbued with the Dark of Nadalia.
