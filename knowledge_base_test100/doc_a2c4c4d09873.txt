In Calcutta his father took him to Rabindranath Tagore, at his house at Jorasanko. He also got the opportunity to meet Abaindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath Tagore in Jorasanko, both brothres criticised and corrected his sketches. From 1911 his paintings began to find place in the monthly magazines published in Calcutta, such as `Prabashi`, `Modern Review`, `Bharatvarsa` and `Bharati`. Mr. W.W. Pearson inspired him to work with dry point, by giving him some copper plates to scratch with a steel pointed needle and used to send those plates to London to be printed as it was not possible to print them in India. 1916 Accompanied Rabindranath Tagore to Japan and USA. 1916 In Japan. 1900 He began his school lessons at the Hamilton High School, Tamluk, Midnapore. 1905-12 Brahmacharya Ashram, Santiniketan. 1912-15 Art Education from Abanindranath Tagore, Indian Society of Oriental Art, Calcutta. 1916 Mrs. Bertha E.

Mukul Dey was the `first Indian etcher` and his astonishing achievement was in the medium `both by way of landscape genre and portraits`. And his forte was drypoint - directly working the sharp - pointed needle on the hard, burnished metal plate, in deep and shallow flow of lines, in literally thousand cross-hatches. And with the needle he had as much effortless facility as he had with chalk, charcoal or conte on paper. A pioneer in the art and craft of intaglio printmaking, he played an important role in popularising the art of printmaking among the Indian artists. He was perhaps the first Indian to take up printmaking as a highly individuated means of artistic expression, instead of as a technique of reproduction. Also he had become famous all over India for his portraits of the celebrities of his time. TEACHING EXPERIENCE 1913-14 Art Teacher, Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan. 1917 Taught at Vichitra Art School, Jorasanko, Calcutta. 1928-43 First Indian Principal of the Government School of Art and Craft, Calcutta.
